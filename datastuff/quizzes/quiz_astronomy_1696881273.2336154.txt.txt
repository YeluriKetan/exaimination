13. The Harvard spectral classification system is a way of categorizing stars based on their characteristics such as temperature, luminosity, and size. It is used in astronomy to better understand the properties of different types of stars and how they evolve over time.
14. Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars outside of our solar system. Their discovery has expanded our knowledge of the universe as it has shown that there are many other planets out there beyond our own solar system. This has also increased the potential for finding extraterrestrial life.
15. Telescopes are essential tools in astronomy as they allow us to see beyond the limitations of the human eye and observe objects that are far away in space. They have greatly advanced our understanding of the universe by helping us discover new celestial bodies and phenomena. With advancements in technology, telescopes have become more powerful and are able to capture detailed images of galaxies and other distant objects.
