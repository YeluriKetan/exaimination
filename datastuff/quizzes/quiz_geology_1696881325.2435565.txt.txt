Free-Response Questions:
1. Lithification is the process of sediment being deposited and compacted over time, resulting in the formation of sedimentary rocks. This process involves the compression and cementation of sediments to form solid rocks. It plays a crucial role in the formation of sedimentary rocks as it helps to preserve fossils and other evidence of past environments.
2. The study of rocks and their formation can help us understand the Earth's history by providing evidence of past environments, tectonic activity, and climate change. It can also give us insights into the processes that shape our planet, such as erosion, weathering, and plate tectonics.
3. Intrusive igneous rocks are formed from molten magma that cools and solidifies beneath the Earth's surface, resulting in large crystal formations due to slower cooling. On the other hand, extrusive igneous rocks are formed from molten lava that cools and solidifies on the Earth's surface, resulting in smaller crystal formations due to rapid cooling.
