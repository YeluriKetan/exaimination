Free-response questions: 
1. Quantum entanglement challenges our understanding of the universe and traditional laws of physics because it defies our classical understanding of how particles interact with each other. It also suggests that there may be a hidden connection between particles that we are not yet aware of. 
2. Quantum entanglement is called spooky action at a distance by Albert Einstein because it violates the principle of locality in physics, where objects cannot have an immediate effect on each other if they are separated by space. This suggests that there may be a non-local hidden connection between the entangled particles.
