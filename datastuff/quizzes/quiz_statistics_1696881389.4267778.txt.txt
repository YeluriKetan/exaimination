B. False

9. The correlation coefficient can be calculated using only the sum of x and y values.
A. True
B. False

Free-response:
11. Explain the meaning of a correlation coefficient of -4.
Answer:

A correlation coefficient of -4 indicates a very strong negative correlation between the two variables. This means that as one variable increases, the other decreases in a very strong and consistent manner.

12. How does the correlation coefficient help us understand the relationship between variables?
Answer:

The correlation coefficient quantifies the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables, allowing us to understand the degree to which they are related. A high positive or negative value of r indicates a strong relationship, while a value close to 0 indicates no relationship. The sign of the coefficient also tells us the direction of the relationship - positive for a direct relationship and negative for an inverse relationship. 

13. Can two variables be perfectly correlated with a coefficient of 0?
Answer:

No, a correlation coefficient of 0 indicates no correlation between the variables. In order for two variables to be perfectly correlated, the coefficient would have to be either 1 or -1.
