6. B
7. C
8. B 
9. C
10. B

True/False:
1. True 
2. True
3. False (Chloroplasts)
4. True 

Free-response:
1. Chlorophyll is a pigment found in the chloroplasts of plant cells. Its main role in photosynthesis is to absorb sunlight and transfer that energy to the photosynthetic process.
2. Photosynthesis is essential for maintaining life on Earth as it provides the oxygen necessary for respiration in all living organisms. It also creates the energy needed for growth and reproduction in plants.
3. The equation for photosynthesis shows how plants use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water from the soil to produce oxygen and glucose. This oxygen is then released into the atmosphere and utilized by other organisms for respiration, while the glucose serves as a source of energy for the plant and other organisms.
4. The three main components of photosynthesis are the absorption of photons by chlorophyll, the electron transport chain, and the production of ATP and NADPH. These components work together to convert sunlight into chemical energy that is used to split water molecules and produce oxygen and glucose.
