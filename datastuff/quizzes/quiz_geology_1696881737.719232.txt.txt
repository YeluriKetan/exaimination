True/False:
1. Rocks are classified into two main categories: igneous and sedimentary.
2. Metamorphic rocks are formed when sediments are deposited and compressed.
3. Igneous rocks can only form on the Earth's surface.
4. Sedimentary rocks can contain fossils.

Free-response:
1. Describe the formation of sedimentary rocks.
2. Explain how the different types of rocks can provide insights into the Earth's history.

8. c

True/False:
1. False
2. False
3. False
4. True

Free-response:
1. Sedimentary rocks are formed when sediments, such as pieces of other rocks, minerals, or organic materials, are deposited and then compacted and cemented together by the weight of overlying layers. This can occur on land or underwater.
2. Igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks can provide insights into the Earth's history by showing the processes that have shaped the Earth's surface and the types of materials that were present during different time periods. For example, sedimentary rocks containing fossils can indicate the types of plants and animals that lived in the past, while metamorphic rocks can provide evidence of ancient tectonic activity.
