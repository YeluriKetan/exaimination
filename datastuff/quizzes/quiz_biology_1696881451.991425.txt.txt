Q1. What is the overall equation for photosynthesis?
A) 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2
B) 6CO2 + 6H2O + C6H12O6 → light energy + 6O2
C) 6CO2 + 6H2O + 6O2 → light energy + C6H12O6
D) C6H12O6 + 6O2 + light energy → 6CO2 + 6H2O

Q2. Which of the following is NOT a product of photosynthesis?
A) Oxygen gas (O2)
B) Water (H2O)
C) Glucose (C6H12O6)
D) Carbon dioxide (CO2)

Q10. Free-response: Why is photosynthesis essential for life on Earth?

Answer key:
1) A
2) B
3) A
4) A
5) D
6) True
7) False
8) Pigments, such as chlorophyll, absorb light energy which is then converted into chemical energy for the process of photosynthesis.
9) The three main steps of photosynthesis are: 1) Absorption of light energy; 2) Conversion of water into oxygen and hydrogen ions; 3) Conversion of carbon dioxide into glucose.
10) Photosynthesis produces oxygen and provides energy for living organisms, making it essential for life on Earth.
