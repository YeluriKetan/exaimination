1. What is the process by which sedimentary rocks are formed?
A. Erosion
B. Volcanism
C. Sedimentation
D. Metamorphism

2. Sediment can come from all of the following sources EXCEPT:
A. Wind
B. Water
C. Plants and animals
D. Meteorites

3. What are the three main types of rocks?
A. Sedentary, igneous, metamorphic
B. Metamorphic, coal, limestone
C. Sedimentary, igneous, metamorphic
D. Sandstone, shale, coal

4. Clastic rocks are composed of __________.
A. Fragments of pre-existing rocks
B. Volcanic ash
C. Precipitated minerals
D. Organic matter

5. Which type of sedimentary rock forms from the remains of plants and animals?
A. Clastic
B. Chemical
C. Organic
D. Metamorphic

6. Sedimentary rocks are important for understanding the Earth's __________.
A. Topography
B. Climate
C. History
D. Volcanic activity

7. Sedimentary rocks are NOT used for __________.
A. Energy resources
B. Building materials
C. Studying geology
D. Jewelry making

8. __________ play(s) a crucial role in the study of geology.
A. Sedimentary rocks
B. Coal and oil
C. Volcanic rocks
D. Metamorphic rocks

9. True/False: Sedimentary rocks can contain valuable resources, such as coal and oil.
A. True
B. False

10. True/False: Chemical rocks are formed through the compaction of sediment over time.
A. True
B. False

11. Free-response: Explain the formation process of sedimentary rocks.
Answer: Sedimentary rocks are formed through sedimentation, which involves the accumulation and gradual compacting of sediment over time. Sediment can come from a variety of sources and as it settles on the bottom of bodies of water, it undergoes compaction and pressure to form a solid rock.

12. Free-response: What are the three main types of sedimentary rocks and how are they classified?
Answer: The three main types of sedimentary rocks are clastic, chemical, and organic. Clastic rocks are classified based on the size and shape of the particles they contain, chemical rocks form from the precipitation of minerals from a solution, and organic rocks are formed from the remains of plants and animals.
