10. Plate tectonics can help predict and prepare for natural disasters by studying the movement and interaction of tectonic plates. By understanding the potential hazards in different regions, scientists can better predict and warn of potential earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and other geological events. This knowledge can also help in preparing and developing strategies to minimize the impact of these disasters on human populations.
