3. True
4. True

Free-response:
1. The Law of Conservation of Mass states that matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction. This means that the total mass of the reactants must be equal to the total mass of the products. This law is important in understanding chemical reactions because it helps us to predict the amounts of substances that will be present before and after a reaction, and to verify the accuracy of experimental results.

2. An example of a decomposition reaction is the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into water (H2O) and oxygen gas (O2). During the reaction, the bonds between the atoms in the hydrogen peroxide molecule are broken, resulting in the formation of water and oxygen gas.

3. Understanding chemical reactions can be helpful in predicting the outcome of reactions because it allows us to identify the types of products that will be formed based on the types of reactants involved. It also helps in designing new materials by allowing us to manipulate and control the reactions to produce desired products. Additionally, understanding chemical reactions is crucial in understanding natural processes, such as photosynthesis and digestion, which involve a series of chemical reactions.
