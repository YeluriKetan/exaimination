13. A food chain is a linear sequence of organisms, while a food web is a complex network of relationships between organisms.
14. A decrease in the number of plants in a food web due to a disease or natural disaster can lead to a decrease in the herbivores that feed on those plants, which in turn can cause a decrease in the number of predators that feed on those herbivores. This can have a cascading effect on the entire system.
