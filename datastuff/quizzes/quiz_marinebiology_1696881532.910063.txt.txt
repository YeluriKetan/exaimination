Multiple Choice:
1. D
2. B
3. B
4. C
5. D
6. B
7. C

True/False:
1. B
2. B
3. B
4. B

Free-response:
1. Plankton are important to the marine food chain because they are the base of the food chain, providing a source of food for larger organisms.
2. An example of an organism that can be classified as both plankton and nekton is a jellyfish, which can float along with ocean currents but also actively swim.
3. Benthic organisms contribute to nutrient cycling in the ocean by breaking down and recycling organic matter on the ocean floor.
