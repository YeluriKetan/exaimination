12. Spiral, elliptical, and irregular galaxies are the three main types of galaxies. Spiral galaxies have a disk-like shape with arms of stars spiraling out from a central bulge. Elliptical galaxies are round or oval in shape and contain mostly old stars. Irregular galaxies have no defined shape.
13. Astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies are not randomly scattered throughout the universe, but are grouped together in clusters. These clusters can contain hundreds or even thousands of galaxies and are held together by their collective gravitational pull.
14. Hierarchical formation is the theory that smaller galaxies merge together to form larger ones. This process is believed to play a significant role in the evolution of galaxies, as many galaxies show signs of past mergers. This theory is supported by the fact that many galaxies have distorted shapes and streams of stars, indicating past collisions and mergers.
