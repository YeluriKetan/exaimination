5. False

Free-response:
1. The three main stages of star formation are the nebula stage, protostar stage, and main sequence stage. During the nebula stage, a cloud of gas and dust collapses due to gravity, forming denser regions. In the protostar stage, the region becomes hot enough for nuclear fusion to occur, and the star begins to emit light and heat. The main sequence stage is the stable phase where the star remains for most of its life.
2. The mass of a star determines its size, brightness, and lifespan. Larger stars have more mass, so they burn through their fuel faster and have shorter lifespans. Smaller stars like our sun have less mass, allowing them to burn for longer and have longer lifespans.
3. By studying stars, we can better understand the formation and evolution of the universe. We can also learn about the elements that make up our world and the processes that create them. Additionally, studying stars can give us insight into our own planet's origins and potential for life on other planets.
