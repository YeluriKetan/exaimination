Free-Response Questions:
1. Describe the formation of stars.
Answer: Stars begin their lives as clouds of gas and dust, known as nebulae. Under the influence of gravity, these clouds start to collapse and become denser and hotter. As the temperature and pressure increase, nuclear fusion reactions begin at the core and a new star is born.

2. What is the final stage of life for low to medium mass stars?
Answer: The final stage of life for low to medium mass stars is a white dwarf. This is a hot, dense core left behind after the outer layers of a red giant or supergiant are ejected. The white dwarf will continue to cool over billions of years until it becomes a black dwarf.

3. How does the life cycle of a high-mass star differ from a low-mass star?
Answer: High-mass stars have a shorter life cycle than low-mass stars. After the red giant or supergiant phase, the core continues to collapse and can trigger a supernova explosion. What's left behind is either a neutron star or a black hole. Low-mass stars, on the other hand, end their lives as white dwarfs.
