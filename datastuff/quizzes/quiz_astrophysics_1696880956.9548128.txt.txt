12. Gravity is the force that governs the motion of objects in the universe. It is described by Einstein's theory of general relativity, which states that mass and energy curve the fabric of space-time, creating the phenomenon of gravity. This force plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of celestial bodies, such as stars and galaxies.
13. Astrophysicists use computer simulations to model and study complex phenomena in the universe, such as the formation of galaxies or the behavior of black holes. These simulations allow researchers to test different scenarios and make predictions, which can then be compared to observations.
14. The hierarchical model proposes that galaxies are formed through the merging of smaller structures over time. This process begins with small structures, such as gas clouds, merging to form larger structures, like dwarf galaxies. These dwarf galaxies then merge to form larger and more massive galaxies. This hierarchical merging process continues until we have the large and complex galaxies we see in the universe today.
