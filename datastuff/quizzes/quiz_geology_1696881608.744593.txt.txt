a) Intrusive igneous
b) Extrusive igneous
c) Sedimentary
d) None of the above

True/False:
1) Igneous rocks are formed from the accumulation and cementation of sediments.
2) Sedimentary rocks have a uniform texture.
3) Metamorphic rocks are formed through intense heat and pressure.
4) Fossils are not commonly found in sedimentary rocks.

Free-response:
1) Describe the formation processes of igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks.
2) How do geologists use the study of rocks to gain insight into the Earth's history?

4) False

Free-response:
1) See content section of text.
2) Geologists use the study of rocks to learn about past environments, the Earth's history, and to make predictions about future geological events.
3) Igneous rocks are formed from cooling and solidification of magma or lava, sedimentary rocks are formed from the accumulation and cementation of sediments, and metamorphic rocks are formed from intense heat and pressure. Igneous rocks can be identified by their crystal size and texture, sedimentary rocks by their layers or fossils, and metamorphic rocks by their bands or lack thereof.
