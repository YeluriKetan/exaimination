True/False:
1. Redshift is the phenomenon where light appears to be shifted towards the blue end of the spectrum.
2. The Doppler effect is responsible for causing redshift.
3. Hubble's discovery of redshift led to the development of the Geocentric theory.
4. Redshift can be used to calculate the speed of an object.

Free-response:
1. Describe the concept of wavelength and how it is related to redshift.
2. Explain how measuring the redshift of an object can help determine its distance.
3. How did Hubble's discovery of redshift contribute to our understanding of the universe?

True/False:
1. False
2. True
3. False
4. True

Free-response:
1. Wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs of a wave. Redshift occurs when an object is moving away from us, causing the wavelength of the light it emits to appear longer and thus more red in color.
2. By measuring the redshift, astronomers can calculate the speed at which an object is moving away from us. This, combined with the known speed of light, can be used to determine the distance of the object.
3. Hubble's discovery of redshift showed that distant galaxies were moving away from us, providing evidence for the expansion of the universe. This led to the development of the Big Bang theory, which is a widely accepted explanation for the origins of the universe.
