10. A) Improve our memory and learning abilities

Free-Response:
1. Implicit memory is the unconscious recollection of information, such as how to ride a bike or tie your shoes. Explicit memory, on the other hand, is the conscious recollection of information, such as recalling a specific event or fact.

2. Attention is a key component of the learning process because it allows the brain to process and encode new information into memory. Without paying attention, new information may not be properly encoded and therefore cannot be stored in memory.

3. The way information is initially encoded can impact how well it is stored and retrieved in the future. For example, information that is actively processed and related to existing knowledge is more likely to be remembered than information that is passively received. This is because actively processing information makes it more meaningful and easier to retrieve in the future.
