1. What is the main purpose of photosynthesis?
A. To convert sunlight into energy
B. To produce carbon dioxide
C. To create oxygen
D. To fuel the plant's growth

2. Where does photosynthesis occur in a plant?
A. Stems
B. Leaves
C. Roots
D. Flowers

3. Photosynthesis can be divided into _________________.
A. Light-dependent and light-independent reactions
B. Water and carbon dioxide
C. Sugars and oxygen
D. ATP and NADPH

4. The light-dependent reactions produce ________________.
A. Oxygen and water
B. ATP and NADPH
C. Glucose and oxygen
D. Carbon dioxide and ATP

5. Which pigment is responsible for absorbing light energy in photosynthesis?
A. Chlorophyll
B. Carotenoids
C. Phycobilins
D. All of the above

6. What is the impact of photosynthesis on the environment?
A. It removes oxygen from the atmosphere
B. It adds carbon dioxide to the atmosphere
C. It removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and releases oxygen
D. It has no impact on the environment.

7. Which of the following is NOT a function of glucose produced during photosynthesis?
A. Fueling the plant's growth
B. Creating oxygen
C. Contributing to the food chain
D. Providing energy for the plant

True or False:
8. Photosynthesis occurs in the mitochondria.
9. Chlorophyll is the only pigment involved in photosynthesis.
10. The light-independent reactions require energy from ATP and NADPH.
11. Photosynthesis has no impact on the environment.

Free Response:
12. Explain the two main stages of photosynthesis.
13. How does photosynthesis contribute to the food chain?
14. Why is understanding photosynthesis important in the study of botany?

Answer Key:
1. A
2. B
3. A
4. B
5. A
6. C
7. B
8. False
9. False
10. True
11. False
12. The two main stages of photosynthesis are the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions. During the light-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is used to produce ATP and NADPH. In the light-independent reactions, carbon dioxide is converted into glucose using the energy from ATP and NADPH.
13. Photosynthesis provides the glucose that plants use as food. This glucose is then consumed by animals, which are then consumed by other animals, creating a food chain.
14. Understanding photosynthesis is essential in the study of botany because it is the process that allows plants to produce their own food and grow. It also has a significant impact on the environment by removing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen.
