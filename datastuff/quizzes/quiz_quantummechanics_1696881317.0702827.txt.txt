D) Hidden variables

7) According to quantum mechanics, the state of an entangled particle is determined when ________.
A) it is created
B) it is measured
C) it is separated
D) it emits a photon

8) Which of the following is NOT a potential application of quantum entanglement?
A) Quantum communication
B) Quantum computing
C) Faster-than-light travel
D) Secure communication

9) True/False: Quantum entanglement has been fully understood and explained by scientists.
A) True
B) False

10) Free-response: In what way does quantum entanglement challenge our classical understanding of information transmission? 

Answer: Quantum entanglement challenges our classical understanding of information transmission because it allows for information to be transmitted instantaneously over large distances, which goes against the classical understanding that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light.
