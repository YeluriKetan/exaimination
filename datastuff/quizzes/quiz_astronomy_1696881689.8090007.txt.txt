4) B (Observations have contributed to our understanding) 

Free-response:
1) The nebular hypothesis suggests that our solar system formed from a large cloud of gas and dust that collapsed under its own gravity. As the cloud collapsed, it began to spin faster and flatten into a disk shape, with the majority of the material collecting in the center to form the Sun. The disk then cooled and clumped together, forming the planets and other objects in our solar system.
2) The planetesimal hypothesis suggests that planets formed from the collision and sticking together of small, solid pieces of material. This theory differs from the nebular hypothesis in that it does not involve the collapse of a cloud of gas and dust, but rather the gradual growth of planets from smaller pieces of material. 
3) Observations of young stars and their surrounding disks have provided evidence and insights into the process of planetary formation. By studying these systems, scientists have been able to observe the stages of planet formation and understand the mechanisms that lead to the formation of different types of planets.
