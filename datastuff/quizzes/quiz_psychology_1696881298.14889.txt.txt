Free-Response:
1. The three main processes of memory are encoding, storage, and retrieval. Encoding is the process of converting information into a form that can be stored in our memory. Storage is the retention of this information over time. And retrieval is the process of accessing and using the stored information when needed.
2. Attention plays a crucial role in memory as it helps us encode information more effectively and transfer it from short-term memory to long-term memory.
3. The three types of memory are sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. Sensory memory holds onto information from our senses for a very brief time, usually less than a second. Short-term memory, also known as working memory, can hold a limited amount of information for a short period of time. Long-term memory is where information is stored for extended periods of time, sometimes even for a lifetime. These types of memory differ in terms of capacity and duration of storage.
