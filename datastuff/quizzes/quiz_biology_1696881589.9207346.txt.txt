1) What is the main purpose of photosynthesis?
a) To absorb light energy
b) To produce oxygen
c) To convert glucose into energy
d) To maintain oxygen levels in the atmosphere

2) Where does photosynthesis occur in the plant?
a) Chlorophyll
b) Mitochondria
c) Cell membrane
d) Chloroplasts

3) Which wavelengths of light do specialized pigments absorb?
a) Red and blue
b) Green and yellow
c) Orange and violet
d) All wavelengths

4) What is the byproduct of photolysis?
a) Hydrogen ions
b) Carbon dioxide
c) Oxygen
d) Glucose

5) What is the final product of photosynthesis?
a) Oxygen
b) Water
c) Glucose
d) Carbon dioxide

6) What is the purpose of ATP in photosynthesis?
a) To split water molecules
b) To absorb light energy
c) To combine hydrogen ions and carbon dioxide
d) To act as an energy carrier

7) True or False: Photosynthesis is only important for plants.
a) True
b) False

8) True or False: The Calvin cycle requires the use of enzymes and ATP.
a) True
b) False

9) Free-response: Explain the process of photolysis.

10) Free-response: How does photosynthesis impact the global ecosystem?

Answer Key:
1) d
2) d
3) a
4) c
5) c
6) d
7) b
8) a
9) Photolysis is the process by which light energy is used to split water molecules into hydrogen ions and oxygen atoms. This produces oxygen as a byproduct and the hydrogen ions are used in the next step of photosynthesis.
10) Photosynthesis plays a crucial role in the global ecosystem by producing oxygen and maintaining its levels in the atmosphere. It also provides energy for plants, which are an important food source for many organisms in the ecosystem. Additionally, the carbon dioxide absorbed during photosynthesis helps to regulate the Earth's climate.
