11. Similarity is the relationship between two figures that have the same shape but may differ in size. This concept is important in real-world applications such as maps, blueprints, and scale models. By understanding similarity, we can accurately create and compare different objects and make predictions based on their properties.
12. Knowing the scale factor of two similar figures would be useful in creating scale models or enlarging/reducing images. For example, if a scale model of a building has a scale factor of 1/4, every 1 cm on the model represents 4 cm in real life, making it easier for engineers to plan and construct the actual building.
