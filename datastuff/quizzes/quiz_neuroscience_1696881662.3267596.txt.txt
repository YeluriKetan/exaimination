8. b
9. a
10. c

True/False:
1. True
2. True
3. True
4. True

Free-response:
1. Synapses are tiny gaps between neurons where electrical and chemical signals are transmitted. This allows for communication between neurons, which is essential for the nervous system to function properly.
2. Understanding the structure and function of different parts of the brain can provide insight into how it works by revealing which regions are responsible for certain functions and how they interact with each other.
3. Genetics, biochemistry, and pharmacology play a role in neuroscience research by providing information about how genes and biochemical processes influence the nervous system and how medications can affect brain function.
