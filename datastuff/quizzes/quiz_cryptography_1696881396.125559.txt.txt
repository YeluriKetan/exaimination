10. Encryption is the process of converting plain text into a secret code to prevent unauthorized access. Decryption is the opposite process of converting the secret code back into plain text.
11. AES has a variable key length, meaning it can use different lengths of keys (128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit) to encrypt data. This makes it more difficult for attackers to crack the encryption.
12. Cryptography is used in modern-day communication through methods such as secure internet connections and encrypted messaging apps to protect sensitive information from being intercepted by third parties.
