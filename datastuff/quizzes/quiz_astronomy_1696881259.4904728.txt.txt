True/False:
1) True
2) False
3) True
4) False

Free-response:
1) Stars are massive spheres of gas that produce their own light and heat through nuclear fusion. The size and temperature of a star determine its brightness and color.
2) Examples of different types of galaxies include spiral, elliptical, and irregular.
3) As comets approach the Sun, the heat causes the ice to vaporize, creating a bright tail. The closer they get, the more bright and visible the tail becomes.
