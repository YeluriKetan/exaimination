A. To study the interactions between living organisms and their environment
B. To understand the complex web of relationships in an ecosystem
C. To protect and conserve our natural world
D. All of the above
Answer: D. All of the above

2. Which of the following best describes a food chain?
A. A linear representation of how energy flows through an ecosystem
B. The interactions between living organisms and their environment
C. The gradual process of change in the structure and composition of an ecosystem
D. The multiple interconnected relationships in an ecosystem
Answer: A. A linear representation of how energy flows through an ecosystem

3. What are producers in a food chain?
A. Herbivores that feed directly on plants
B. Carnivores that eat the herbivores
C. Organisms that use the sun's energy to produce food
D. Apex predators that feed on other carnivores
Answer: C. Organisms that use the sun's energy to produce food

4. Which of the following is true about a food web?
A. It is a more simplistic version of a food chain
B. It takes into account that organisms can be both predators and prey
C. It only includes primary and secondary consumers
D. It does not accurately represent the feeding relationships in an ecosystem
Answer: B. It takes into account that organisms can be both predators and prey

5. What is ecological succession?
A. The gradual process of change in the structure and composition of an ecosystem
B. The linear representation of how energy flows through an ecosystem
C. The study of how living organisms interact with each other and their environment
D. The natural disturbances that occur in an ecosystem
Answer: A. The gradual process of change in the structure and composition of an ecosystem

6. Which of the following can trigger ecological succession?
A. Human activities like deforestation
B. Natural disturbances like wildfires
C. Both A and B
D. None of the above
Answer: C. Both A and B

7. Which of the following is NOT a key concept in ecology?
A. Food web
B. Ecological succession
C. Natural disturbances
D. Food chain
Answer: C. Natural disturbances

True/False:
8. Ecology is the study of how living organisms interact with each other and their environment.
Answer: True

9. In a food chain, tertiary consumers are apex predators.
Answer: True

10. Ecological succession can only be triggered by human activities.
Answer: False

Free-response:
11. How does a food web differ from a food chain?
Answer: A food web is a more complex and realistic representation of the feeding relationships in an ecosystem, taking into account that organisms can have multiple food sources and can be both predators and prey. A food chain, on the other hand, is a linear representation of how energy flows through an ecosystem.

12. How can ecological succession have both positive and negative impacts on an ecosystem?
Answer: Ecological succession can lead to the development of a more stable and diverse ecosystem, which can be positive. However, it can also have negative impacts on certain species that may not be able to adapt to the changes, leading to a loss of biodiversity. Additionally, human activities that trigger ecological succession, such as deforestation, can have negative impacts on the environment. 

Answer Key:
1. D
2. A
3. C
4. B
5. A
6. C
7. D
8. True
9. True
10. False
11. A food web takes into account multiple food sources and organisms being both predators and prey, while a food chain is a linear representation.
12. Ecological succession can lead to a more stable and diverse ecosystem, but can also have negative impacts on certain species and can be triggered by human activities.
