11. The inner planets are smaller in size, made up of dense, rocky material, have shorter orbital periods, and higher temperatures compared to the outer planets. The outer planets are larger in size, primarily made up of gas and ice, have longer orbital periods, and lower temperatures compared to the inner planets.
12. Studying the Solar System allows us to understand the conditions necessary for life to exist and how these conditions may vary on different planets. It also helps us identify potential locations where life could exist beyond Earth.
13. The Solar System is believed to have formed from a giant cloud of gas and dust known as the solar nebula. As the cloud collapsed due to its own gravity, it began to spin and flatten into a disk. The central part of the disk became the sun, while the remaining material coalesced to form the planets, moons, and other objects in the Solar System. The inner planets formed closer to the sun, where the higher temperatures did not allow for the retention of lighter gases, while the outer planets formed further away where the lower temperatures allowed for the retention of these gases. The leftover debris in the disk eventually formed the asteroid belt.
