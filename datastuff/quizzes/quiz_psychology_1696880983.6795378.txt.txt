True/False:
1. Learning and memory are two separate and unrelated processes.
2. Long-term memory has limited storage capacity.
3. Operant conditioning refers to the process of learning through consequences.
4. Procedural memory is the memory for factual information.

Free-response:
1. Explain the difference between classical and operant conditioning.
2. How does the Atkinson-Shiffrin model explain the process of memory?
3. Can you give an example of how context and cues can affect retrieval from long-term memory?

Answer key:
MCQs: 1. c, 2. c, 3. c, 4. b, 5. a, 6. c, 7. b, 8. b, 9. b, 10. b
True/False: 1. False, 2. False, 3. True, 4. False
Free-response: 1. Classical conditioning is a type of learning where a neutral stimulus is paired with a conditioned stimulus to create a conditioned response, while operant conditioning is a type of learning where behavior is strengthened or weakened by the consequences that follow. 
2. The Atkinson-Shiffrin model proposes that information enters our sensory memory, then moves to short-term memory, and, if deemed important, is transferred to long-term memory. Retrieval of information from long-term memory can be affected by factors such as context and cues.
3. An example of how context and cues can affect retrieval from long-term memory is seeing a familiar place where you used to live, which can trigger the retrieval of memories associated with that place.
