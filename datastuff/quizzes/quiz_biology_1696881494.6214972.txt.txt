FR1. The two main stages of photosynthesis are the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions. The products of the light-dependent reactions are oxygen and ATP, while the products of the light-independent reactions are glucose.
FR2. Glucose is used by plants as a source of energy, to build cell walls, and to provide energy for cellular processes.
FR3. Photosynthesis is essential for sustaining life on Earth as it produces oxygen for cellular respiration and provides energy for all living organisms through the production of glucose. Without photosynthesis, there would be no source of food or oxygen for living things.
