True/False:
1. Accretion is the process of planets forming from dust and gas in a disk surrounding a young star. (True)
2. The outer planets were formed from heavier materials like iron and rock. (False)
3. The location of a planet in the solar system does not impact its formation. (False)

3. False
4. True

Free-response:
1. The nebular hypothesis suggests that the solar system was formed from a massive cloud of gas and dust that collapsed under its own gravity. As the cloud collapsed, it began to spin faster and flatten into a disk, with the sun forming in the center and the planets forming from the leftover material in the outer regions.
2. The different types of planets are inner planets, outer planets, gas giants, and dwarf planets. Inner planets, like Mercury and Mars, are smaller and rocky, while outer planets, like Jupiter and Saturn, are larger and made primarily of gas and ice. Gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn, are primarily made of gas, while dwarf planets, like Pluto, are smaller and do not have enough mass to clear their orbit.
3. Studying the formation of planets can help us understand the physical processes that shaped our own planet, as well as the conditions necessary for a planet to support life. It also allows us to gain insights into the early stages of our solar system and how it has evolved over time.
