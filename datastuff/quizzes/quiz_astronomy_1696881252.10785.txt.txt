4. False

Free-Response:
1. Galileo's discovery of four large moons orbiting around Jupiter challenged the belief that all celestial objects revolved around the Earth, supporting the Copernican model that states that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun.
2. The inner planets are smaller, denser, and composed of mostly rock and metal. The outer planets are larger, less dense, and mainly composed of gas and ice.
3. The Sun provides heat, light, and energy to all the planets in the Solar System. Its energy is generated through nuclear fusion, where hydrogen atoms combine to form helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy.
