7) B
8) B
9) B
10) A
True/False:
1) False
2) False
3) True
4) False

Free-response:
1) The force of gravity between two objects is directly proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This means that the larger the masses of the objects, the stronger the force of gravity will be, and the farther apart the objects are, the weaker the force of gravity will be.
2) Astrophysics helps us understand the physical properties and processes of celestial objects and the universe as a whole. It allows us to gather information about galaxies, stars, and other objects that are too far away to study directly. This information helps us understand the origins and evolution of the universe.
3) Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation that is emitted by all objects in the universe. By studying this radiation, we can gather information about the composition, temperature, and movement of celestial objects. This is essential for understanding the physical properties and behavior of these objects.
