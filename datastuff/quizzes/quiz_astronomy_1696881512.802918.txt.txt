True/False:
1) True
2) True
3) False
4) False

Free-response:
1) Hydrogen gas, with small amounts of other elements such as helium, carbon, and oxygen.
2) Nuclear fusion provides the energy that prevents the forming star from collapsing further.
3) The mass of a star determines the rate at which it consumes its fuel, therefore affecting its lifespan.
