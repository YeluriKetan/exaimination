15. Photosynthesis is the process through which plants absorb carbon from the atmosphere and convert it into organic compounds, which can be passed on to other organisms through the food chain. This is an important part of the carbon cycle as it helps regulate the Earth's temperature.
16. Deforestation leads to a decrease in the number of plants, which reduces the amount of carbon being absorbed through photosynthesis. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon that has been stored in the Earth's crust back into the atmosphere, increasing atmospheric CO2 levels. Both of these activities disrupt the natural balance of the carbon cycle, leading to an increase in greenhouse gases and contributing to global warming.
