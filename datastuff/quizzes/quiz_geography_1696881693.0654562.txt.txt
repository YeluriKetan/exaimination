8. C

True/False:
1. False
2. True
3. False
4. False

Free-Response:
1. Rivers contribute to the natural resources of a region by carrying sediments and nutrients downstream, providing fertile soil for agriculture, and serving as a source of transportation and energy.
2. Altitude can affect climate by determining the temperature and precipitation patterns in a region. As altitude increases, the temperature generally decreases and precipitation can also change.
3. Understanding physical geography can help us make informed decisions about disaster preparedness by identifying areas prone to natural disasters, such as floods or landslides, and implementing strategies to mitigate their impact.
