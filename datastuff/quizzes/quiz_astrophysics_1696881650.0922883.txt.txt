12. The temperature and size of a star determine its color and brightness. Higher temperatures result in bluer stars, while lower temperatures result in redder stars. A star's brightness is determined by its size, with larger stars being brighter.
13. Stars are born from clouds of gas and dust called nebulae. As the gas and dust are compressed, the temperature and pressure increases, eventually leading to nuclear fusion and the birth of a star. The mass of a star determines its lifespan and eventual fate. Smaller stars, such as red dwarfs, can burn for billions of years, while larger stars, such as supergiants, have shorter lifespans and eventually explode in a supernova.
14. Spectroscopy is the process of analyzing the light emitted by stars. By breaking down the light into its component wavelengths, astronomers can determine the chemical makeup of the star. This allows us to understand the different layers and processes happening within a star and how they contribute to its overall behavior. For example, the presence of certain elements, such as hydrogen and helium, can indicate the stage of a star's life cycle.
