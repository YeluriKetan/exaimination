Free-Response:
1. The Gulf Stream brings warm water from the Gulf of Mexico to the eastern coast of the United States, leading to warmer temperatures in this region. It also flows towards Europe and moderates the climate there, preventing extreme temperature changes.
2. Scientists track and measure ocean currents using tools such as satellites, buoys, and ships. They also use computer models and conduct field research to study these currents.
3. Upwellings are important for maintaining the health of oceans as they bring nutrient-rich water to the surface, supporting a thriving ecosystem of plankton, fish, and other marine life. This, in turn, supports a larger food chain and contributes to the overall health and productivity of the oceans.
