11. Astronomers use spectroscopy to study the light emitted from celestial objects. By analyzing the different wavelengths of light, they can determine the composition, temperature, and movement of the object.
12. Three stages in the lifecycle of a star are: formation from a cloud of gas and dust, fusion in the core, and eventual death as a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole.
13. The search for exoplanets is important because it allows us to better understand the formation and evolution of our own solar system. It also provides insight into the potential for life on other planets and expands our understanding of the vastness of the universe.
