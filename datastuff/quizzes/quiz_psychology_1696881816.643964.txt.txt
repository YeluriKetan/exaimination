10. Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt in response to experiences and environmental factors. It is a crucial aspect of brain development, as it allows the brain to form new connections and pathways while pruning away unused ones. This process is guided by genetic factors but is also influenced by the environment and experiences. Through neuroplasticity, the brain can continue to develop and adapt throughout a person's lifetime, shaping their thoughts, emotions, and actions.
