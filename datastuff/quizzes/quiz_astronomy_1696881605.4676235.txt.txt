True/False:
1. Stars are formed when clouds of gas and dust collapse due to gravity. (True)
2. Nuclear fusion is the process of splitting atoms to release energy. (False)
3. Larger stars have longer lifetimes than smaller stars. (False)
4. All stars will eventually become black holes. (False)

Free-response:
1. Describe the process of nuclear fusion in a protostar.
2. How does a star's mass impact its lifespan?
3. What happens to a star after it exhausts its hydrogen fuel?

Answer Key:
MCQs:
1. c
2. b
3. c
4. d
5. d
6. a
7. a

True/False:
1. True
2. False
3. False
4. False

Free-response:
1. As a protostar collapses, the increase in temperature and pressure at its core triggers hydrogen atoms to fuse together, creating helium and releasing a tremendous amount of energy.
2. A star's mass determines how long it will spend on the main sequence and ultimately what fate it will have after its death.
3. After a star exhausts its hydrogen fuel, it will enter a new stage in its life cycle, either becoming a red giant, supernova, or collapsing into a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole.
