12. Gravity plays a crucial role in the formation of stars by causing molecular clouds to collapse, which increases density, temperature, and pressure within the cloud, triggering nuclear fusion.
13. Smaller stars, such as red dwarfs, can sustain fusion for billions of years due to their lower mass and slower fusion rate. Larger stars, such as red giants, have a shorter lifespan due to their higher mass and faster fusion rate.
14. Once the fusion process is complete, a star can become a white dwarf, neutron star, black hole, or enter a new stage in its life cycle, such as a red giant. A white dwarf is the core of a dead star, a neutron star is a small but extremely dense star, and a black hole is a region of space with a gravitational pull so strong that not even light can escape.
