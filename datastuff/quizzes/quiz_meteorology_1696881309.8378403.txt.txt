10. Free-response: Explain the difference between a cold front and a warm front.

Answer: A cold front occurs when a mass of cold air moves into an area of warmer air, pushing the warm air up and causing thunderstorms and heavy rain. A warm front, on the other hand, happens when a mass of warm air moves into an area of colder air, causing a gradual and steady increase in temperature and potentially bringing light rain or drizzle.
