11. Describe the primary role of leaves in plants.

12. How does asexual reproduction differ from sexual reproduction in plants?

13. What is the purpose of taxonomy in botany?

Answer Key:
1. D) Carrying out photosynthesis
2. C) Geology
3. B) Photosynthesis
4. C) 300,000
5. D) Pollen
6. A) Sexual
7. A) Taxonomy
8. B) Producing oxygen
9. B) False
10. C) Ecology
11. Leaves are responsible for photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy.
12. Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of male and female gametes, resulting in genetically diverse offspring, while asexual reproduction involves the production of new plants from a single parent without the need for gamete fusion.
13. Taxonomy is used to classify plants based on their similarities and differences, helping us understand the relationships between different plant species and how they evolved over time.
