Answer Key:
Multiple Choice:
1. d
2. c
3. d
4. c
5. b
6. c
7. d
8. a

True/False:
1. False
2. True
3. False
4. False

Free-Response:
1. Light is absorbed by pigments in the chloroplasts and is used to excite electrons, which then go through a series of reactions to produce ATP and NADPH.
2. Water is split into hydrogen ions and oxygen, and the hydrogen ions are used in the production of ATP and NADPH, which are necessary for the production of glucose.
3. Carbon dioxide is taken in through small openings on the leaves called stomata and is combined with ATP and NADPH to produce glucose through the Calvin cycle.
