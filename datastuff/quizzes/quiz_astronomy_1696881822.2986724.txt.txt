Free Response:
1. The strength of gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to the masses of the objects and inversely proportional to the distance between them.
2. Technology has allowed us to observe and track planetary motion with greater precision, leading to more accurate predictions and discoveries.
3. Retrograde motion helps us understand the relative positions and speeds of different planets in our solar system, as well as the phenomenon of optical illusions in astronomy.
