True/False:
1. Photosynthesis occurs in the nucleus. (False)
2. The byproduct of photosynthesis is oxygen. (True)
3. The thylakoid membrane contains pigments that absorb light energy. (True)
4. The Calvin cycle uses ATP and hydrogen ions to convert carbon dioxide into glucose. (False)

Free-response:
1. Describe the role of the electron transport chain in photosynthesis.
2. Explain the significance of ATP in the Calvin cycle.
3. How does photosynthesis contribute to the overall energy balance on Earth?

Answer Key:
Multiple Choice:
1. C
2. C
3. B
4. A
5. D
6. C
7. B
8. B

True/False:
1. False
2. True
3. True
4. False

Free-response:
1. The electron transport chain plays a crucial role in photosynthesis as it utilizes the energy from electrons to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid lumen, creating a concentration gradient that is used to generate ATP.
2. ATP is an important energy source in the Calvin cycle, as it provides the energy necessary for the conversion of carbon dioxide into glucose.
3. Photosynthesis contributes to the overall energy balance on Earth by converting sunlight into chemical energy that is used by plants and other organisms for their metabolic processes. It also produces oxygen, which is essential for aerobic respiration.
