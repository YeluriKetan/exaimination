True/False:
1. Photosynthesis occurs only in terrestrial plants. (False)
2. Marine plants use chlorophyll and carotenoids to absorb sunlight. (True)
3. Light-independent reactions do not require light to occur. (False)
4. Marine plants have smaller stomata to prevent water loss. (True)

Free-response:

True/False:
1. False
2. True
3. False
4. True

Free-response:
1. The two stages of photosynthesis in marine plants are light-dependent reactions and light-independent reactions. In the light-dependent reactions, light energy is used to split water molecules and produce oxygen, protons, and electrons. In the light-independent reactions, the energy from the sun is used to combine carbon dioxide, protons, and electrons to produce glucose.
2. Marine plants are important for the ocean ecosystem because they produce oxygen, provide food, and play a crucial role in the carbon cycle. They are also a food source for other marine organisms.
3. Marine plants have adapted to the marine environment by having thicker cell walls, smaller stomata, specialized pigments, and the ability to conserve water. These adaptations help them to survive and thrive in the salty and watery environment.
