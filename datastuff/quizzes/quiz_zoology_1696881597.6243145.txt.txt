a) Botany
b) Zoology
c) Animal classification
d) Taxonomy

2) The Linnaean system of classification was developed by a botanist named:
a) Charles Darwin
b) Gregor Mendel
c) Carolus Linnaeus
d) Jean-Baptiste Lamarck

3) Which of the following is NOT one of the main levels in the Linnaean system?
a) Domain
b) Kingdom
c) Genus
d) Class

4) Cladistics is a classification method based on:
a) Physical characteristics
b) Evolutionary relationships
c) Environmental conditions
d) Diet and habitat

5) Which principle of animal classification states that organisms with common ancestors are more closely related?
a) Principle of homology
b) Principle of analogy
c) Principle of ancestry
d) Principle of diversity

6) Phylogenetic trees are diagrams used to show:
a) Behavioral characteristics of animals
b) Genetic similarities between species
c) Environmental factors affecting animals
d) Physical differences between organisms

7) Which of the following is NOT a principle of animal classification?
a) Principle of ancestry
b) Principle of homology
c) Principle of diversity
d) Principle of analogy

8) The study of animal classification falls under the branch of science called:
a) Geology
b) Botany
c) Zoology
d) Physics

True/False:
1) The Linnaean system of classification uses a hierarchical approach.
2) Cladistics looks at genetic and anatomical similarities between organisms to determine their classification.
3) The principle of homology states that organisms with similar traits have a common ancestor.
4) Phylogenetic trees show the evolutionary relationships between different species.

Free-response:
1) What is the difference between the Linnaean system and cladistics in terms of classification methods?
2) Why is animal classification important in the field of zoology?
3) Can organisms with similar physical characteristics be classified in different levels of the Linnaean system? Explain why or why not.

Answer key:
MCQs:
1) c) Animal classification
2) c) Carolus Linnaeus
3) a) Domain
4) b) Evolutionary relationships
5) c) Principle of ancestry
6) b) Genetic similarities between species
7) c) Principle of diversity
8) c) Zoology

True/False:
1) True
2) True
3) True
4) True

Free-response:
1) The Linnaean system uses a hierarchical approach, while cladistics is based on evolutionary relationships.
2) Animal classification is important in zoology because it helps us understand the diversity of life on Earth and the evolutionary relationships between different species.
3) No, organisms with similar physical characteristics are classified in the same level of the Linnaean system. This is because the system is based on a hierarchical approach, where organisms with more similarities are grouped together at a higher level.
