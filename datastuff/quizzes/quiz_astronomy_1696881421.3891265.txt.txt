2. Protostars are formed from collapsing clouds of gas and dust. (True)
3. Nuclear fusion begins in a protostar when it reaches a certain size. (False)
4. Larger stars will eventually become red giants. (True)

Free-response:
1. How does a star's mass determine its life cycle?

2. What happens to a star after it goes through a supernova?

3. How can studying a star's life cycle help us understand the creation and evolution of the universe?

Answer Key:
MCQs: 1. B, 2. B, 3. B, 4. B, 5. C, 6. A, 7. C, 8. B, 9. A, 10. A
True/False: 1. False, 2. True, 3. False, 4. True
Free-response:
1. A star's mass determines its life cycle because it determines the amount of pressure and heat in the core, which affects the fusion of elements and the star's eventual fate.
2. After a supernova, the remnants of a star may form a neutron star or a black hole, depending on its mass.
3. Studying a star's life cycle can help us understand the creation and evolution of the universe by giving us insights into how different elements are formed and how they are distributed throughout the universe. It also allows us to see the various stages of a star's life and how they contribute to the overall structure and functioning of the universe.
