Free-Response Questions:
10. Explain the process of how our solar system formed.

Answer: Our solar system formed from a large, rotating cloud of gas and dust known as a nebula. As the nebula collapsed under its own gravity, it began to spin faster and flatten into a disk shape. The center of the disk became increasingly dense and hot, eventually forming the Sun. Meanwhile, the remaining material in the disk began to clump together due to gravity. These clumps, called planetesimals, collided and merged to form larger objects, eventually becoming the planets we know today.

11. What are the differences between the inner and outer planets, in terms of composition and location?

Answer: The inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, are made mostly of rock and metal and are closer to the Sun. The outer planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, are primarily composed of gas and ice and are farther from the Sun. The inner planets are smaller in size compared to the outer planets and have shorter orbits around the Sun.

12. How do smaller objects like asteroids and comets provide information about our solar system's early formation?

Answer: Smaller objects like asteroids and comets are leftover from the process of planet formation. By studying their composition and orbits, scientists can gain insights into the conditions and processes that were present during the early formation of our solar system. These objects can also provide clues about the materials that were present in the original nebula that formed our solar system.
