Free-response:
1. Wave-particle duality refers to the concept that particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior. An example of an experiment that demonstrates this is the double-slit experiment, where a single beam of light or electrons can produce a pattern similar to a wave when passed through two narrow slits.
2. The development of quantum mechanics has led to significant technological advances, such as transistors and lasers. It has also greatly enhanced our understanding of the microscopic world and has allowed us to manipulate particles at the atomic level.
3. Quantum mechanics is still a subject of ongoing debate and research because it challenges our understanding of the physical world and can produce counterintuitive results. It also involves complex mathematics and theories that are difficult to prove experimentally.
