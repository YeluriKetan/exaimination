True/False:
1. In quantum mechanics, particles are described as solid objects. (False)
2. The uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to know the position or momentum of a particle with absolute certainty. (True)
3. The cat in Schrödinger's cat experiment exists in a state of superposition. (True)
4. The double-slit experiment shows that particles can only behave like waves. (False)

Free-Response:
1. Explain the concept of wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics.

2. Give an example of how the uncertainty principle is demonstrated in everyday life.

ANSWER KEY:
1. A
2. A
3. C
4. A
5. C
6. B
7. B
8. False
9. True
10. False
11. Wave-particle duality is the concept in quantum mechanics that describes how particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior. This means that particles can have characteristics of both waves and solid objects, depending on the experiment being conducted.
12. One example of how the uncertainty principle is demonstrated in everyday life is in the measurement of a particle's position and momentum. According to the principle, it is impossible to know both properties with absolute certainty, so there will always be some level of uncertainty in the measurement. This can be seen in the fuzziness of an image taken with a camera or the blurriness of a moving object in a photograph.
