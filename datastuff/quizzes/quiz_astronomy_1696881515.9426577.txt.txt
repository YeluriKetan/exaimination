Free-response:
1. The first law of planetary motion, also known as the law of ellipses, states that all planets in our solar system move in elliptical orbits around the sun, with the sun being located at one of the two foci of the ellipse.
2. Kepler's laws of planetary motion revolutionized the field of astronomy by providing a mathematical basis for understanding the movement of planets in our solar system. They also led to the discovery of new planets and paved the way for future scientific advancements.
3. The first law, also known as the law of ellipses, describes the shape of a planet's orbit. The second law, or the law of equal areas, explains the speed of a planet as it orbits the sun. The third law, known as the law of harmonies, relates the orbital period of a planet to its distance from the sun. All three laws work together to accurately predict the motion of planets in our solar system.
