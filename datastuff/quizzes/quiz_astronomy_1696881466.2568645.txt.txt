A. Super-Earth
B. Hot Jupiter
C. Earth-like
D. Blue Neptune
Answer: B

True/False:
8. The radial velocity technique measures the slight wobble of a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.
Answer: True

9. Exoplanets only come in one size and composition.
Answer: False

10. The transit method looks for dips in a star's brightness as a planet passes in front of it.
Answer: True

11. Spectroscopy is a method used to detect exoplanets.
Answer: False

Free-response:
12. Briefly explain the radial velocity technique used to detect exoplanets.
Answer: The radial velocity technique measures the slight wobble of a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. Astronomers use this method to detect exoplanets by observing the changes in the star's velocity, which can indicate the presence of an orbiting planet.

13. Why is understanding exoplanets important in our search for extraterrestrial life?
Answer: Understanding exoplanets is important in our search for extraterrestrial life because by studying their atmospheres, scientists can determine if a planet has the necessary conditions for life to exist. Exoplanets can also provide valuable information about the formation and evolution of our own solar system. Furthermore, the existence of exoplanets increases the likelihood of finding habitable planets and potential life beyond Earth.
