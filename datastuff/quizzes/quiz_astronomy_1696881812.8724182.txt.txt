Free-response:
11. How does the gravitational pull of the sun affect the speed of a planet in its orbit?

12. Give an example of a real-life application of the concept of orbital motion.

Answer Key:
1. B
2. C
3. B
4. B
5. B
6. D
7. D
8. A

10. B
11. The gravitational pull of the sun causes a planet to speed up as it moves closer to the sun and slow down as it moves farther away.
12. Answers may vary. One example could be using the concept of orbital motion to plan satellite launches, as the trajectory and speed of the satellite need to be precisely calculated in order for it to successfully orbit around a planet.
