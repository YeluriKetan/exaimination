11. Species richness and species evenness are measures of biodiversity. Species richness is the total number of different species in a given area. Species evenness looks at the relative abundance of each species in the ecosystem.
12. One major benefit of biodiversity is the provision of ecosystem services, such as water and air purification, nutrient cycling, and pollination. These services are essential for human well-being and contribute to economic stability.
13. Human activities like deforestation, pollution, and overexploitation of resources can impact biodiversity by reducing the number of species and disrupting ecosystem balance. To protect biodiversity, sustainable practices can be implemented, such as reforestation, responsible resource management, and reducing pollution. Education and awareness about the value of biodiversity can also help promote conservation efforts.
