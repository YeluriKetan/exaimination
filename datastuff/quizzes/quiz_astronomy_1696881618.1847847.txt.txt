12) The three main types of stars are main sequence stars, red giants, and white dwarfs. Main sequence stars are stable, medium-sized stars in the prime of their life. Red giants are larger, cooler stars nearing the end of their life cycle. White dwarfs are dense, leftover cores of old stars.
13) Understanding the different types of stars allows astronomers to classify and study the vast array of stars in the universe. It also helps predict their life cycle and future behavior.
14) Stars are the building blocks of galaxies and play a crucial role in the formation of planets and solar systems by providing light, heat, and elements necessary for life. They also help keep planets in orbit around a central star.
