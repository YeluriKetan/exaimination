Free-response

1. Describe the role of chlorophyll in photosynthesis.
Answer: Chlorophyll is a green pigment found in chloroplasts that absorbs sunlight and initiates the process of photosynthesis. Without chlorophyll, plants would not be able to absorb sunlight and convert it into energy.

2. Explain the two stages of photosynthesis.
Answer: The first stage is the light-dependent reactions, where sunlight is used to split water molecules and produce oxygen. The second stage is the light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin cycle, where the energy from the first stage is used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose.

3. How does photosynthesis benefit the ecosystem?
Answer: Photosynthesis is crucial for maintaining a balance of gases in the atmosphere. It also produces oxygen, which is essential for the respiration of animals. Additionally, the glucose produced during photosynthesis serves as a source of energy for other living organisms.
