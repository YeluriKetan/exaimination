B. False

7. How do minerals help in the formation of sedimentary rocks?
A. They bind sediment particles together.
B. They break down rocks into smaller pieces.

15. Describe the process of lithification.

Answer: Lithification is the process by which sediment is compacted and cemented together to form sedimentary rock. This process involves the weight of overlying sediment and minerals present in the water binding sediment particles together, creating a solid rock.

16. How do sedimentary rocks preserve fossils?

Answer: Sedimentary rocks preserve fossils by providing a protective environment for the remains or impressions of plants and animals. As layers of sediment are compacted and cemented, fossils are trapped and preserved within the rock, providing valuable information about past environments and the Earth's history.

17. Why are sedimentary rocks important to the study of geology?

Answer: Sedimentary rocks are important to the study of geology because they provide valuable information about the Earth's history and its ever-changing environments. By studying sedimentary rocks, scientists can gain insights into past climates, ecosystems, and geological processes, helping us understand the complexities of the Earth.
