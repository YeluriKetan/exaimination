2. True
3. False
4. False

Free-response:
1. The formation of a star begins with a nebula, a cloud of gas and dust. This nebula collapses under the force of gravity to form a protostar, which grows as more material is pulled in. Once the temperature in the core reaches about 10 million degrees Celsius, nuclear fusion begins and the star enters the main sequence stage.
2. A star's mass and composition are the main factors in determining its size, temperature, and color. A larger star will have a higher temperature and a bluer color, while a smaller star will have a lower temperature and a redder color.
3. Besides providing light and energy, stars also serve as the building blocks for planets and other celestial bodies. As they die, they release heavy elements into the universe, which can then form new stars, planets, and even life. They also play a crucial role in the evolution of the universe, as their deaths can lead to the formation of new galaxies and structures.
