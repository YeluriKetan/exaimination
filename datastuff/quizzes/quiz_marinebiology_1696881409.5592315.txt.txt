10. Marine animals are interconnected in an ecosystem because each species plays a specific role in maintaining the balance of the ocean. For example, plankton serve as a food source for larger animals, while apex predators help control the population of smaller species.
11. Studying the feeding strategies of marine animals is important because it provides insight into the health of the ocean and can help identify potential issues or imbalances in the ecosystem. It also helps scientists understand the role of each species in the ecosystem.
12. An imbalance in one species can affect the entire marine ecosystem because all species are interconnected and rely on each other for survival. For example, if an apex predator population decreases, their prey population may increase, leading to a decrease in the population of their prey's food source. This can have a domino effect on the entire food web, ultimately affecting the overall balance of the ecosystem.
