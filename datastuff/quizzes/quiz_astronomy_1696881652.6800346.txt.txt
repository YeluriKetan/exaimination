Free-Response Answers:
1. Black holes are different from other objects in the universe because their gravitational pull is so strong that even light cannot escape, making them invisible to the naked eye.
2. Scientists hope to learn more about the formation and behavior of black holes through further research and observations, which could provide insight into the evolution of galaxies and the universe.
3. Black holes can impact their surroundings by pulling in and heating up matter, emitting radiation, and potentially affecting the movement and development of other celestial objects.
