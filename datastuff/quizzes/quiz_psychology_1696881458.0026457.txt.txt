Free-response:
1. Explain the difference between positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement.
Answer:
Positive reinforcement involves giving a reward after a desired behavior is performed, while negative reinforcement involves removing an unpleasant stimulus after a desired behavior is performed. In positive reinforcement, the reward serves as a motivator to increase the likelihood of the behavior happening again, while in negative reinforcement, the removal of an unpleasant stimulus serves as a relief and also increases the likelihood of the behavior occurring again.

2. How does punishment differ from reinforcement in operant conditioning?
Answer:
Punishment aims to decrease the likelihood of a behavior occurring again, while reinforcement aims to increase the likelihood of a behavior occurring again. In punishment, an unpleasant consequence is given after an undesired behavior is performed, while in reinforcement, a reward or removal of an unpleasant stimulus is given after a desired behavior is performed. Punishment focuses on decreasing undesired behaviors, while reinforcement focuses on increasing desired behaviors.
