C) Supernova
D) Main sequence

10) Which of the following is NOT a possible outcome for a star after the red giant phase?
A) White dwarf
B) Neutron star
C) Protostar
D) Black hole

True/False:
1) The red giant phase is the last stage of a star's life.
2) Nuclear fusion creates the energy that allows stars to shine.
3) The main sequence is the longest stage of a star's life.
4) High-mass stars go through fewer stages of stellar evolution than low-mass stars.

Free-response:
1) What is the role of nuclear fusion in a star's life?
2) How does the end point of stellar evolution differ for low-mass and high-mass stars?
3) How does understanding stellar evolution help us understand the universe as a whole?

Answer key:
MCQs: 1) C, 2) B, 3) D, 4) B, 5) C, 6) A, 7) A, 8) D, 9) A, 10) C
True/False: 1) False, 2) True, 3) True, 4) False
Free-response: 1) Nuclear fusion creates the energy that allows stars to shine and also creates heavier elements in the core of the star. 2) Low-mass stars end as white dwarfs, while high-mass stars may end as neutron stars or black holes. 3) Understanding stellar evolution helps us understand the origins of the elements in our universe and the life cycle of stars.
