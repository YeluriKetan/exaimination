4) B

Free-response:
1) Nuclear fusion is the primary process that powers main sequence stars.
2) Giant stars begin as main sequence stars, but as they run out of hydrogen fuel, their outer layers expand and they become larger and brighter. Eventually, they will exhaust all their fuel and either become a white dwarf or a neutron star.
3) White dwarfs form when a giant star exhausts all its nuclear fuel and collapses under its own gravity.
4) The main difference between a neutron star and a white dwarf is their size and density. Neutron stars are much smaller and denser than white dwarfs.
