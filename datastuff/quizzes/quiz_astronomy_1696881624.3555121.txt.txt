Free-response:
1. The cosmic microwave background radiation is a faint glow of radiation leftover from the intense heat of the early universe. Its discovery supports the Big Bang Theory because it is evidence of the rapid expansion and cooling of the universe after the initial singularity.

2. Dark energy and dark matter are two mysterious substances that make up the majority of the universe, with dark energy being responsible for the acceleration of the universe's expansion and dark matter providing the gravitational pull to hold galaxies together.

3. The Big Bang Theory is the prevailing scientific explanation for the origin of the universe because it is supported by evidence such as the cosmic microwave background radiation and the observations of dark energy and dark matter. Additionally, it has successfully predicted and explained various astronomical phenomena.
