B. Plants
C. Animals
D. All of the above

True/False:
1. Sedimentation is the gradual accumulation of sediment on the Earth's surface.
A. True
B. False

2. Sedimentation only occurs in bodies of water.
A. True
B. False

3. The velocity of the water in sedimentation areas is high.
A. True
B. False

Free-response:
1. How does sedimentation play a role in the preservation of fossils?

2. Name three natural forces that can contribute to erosion and sedimentation.

3. Describe the process of sedimentation and how it forms layers over time.

Answer Key: 
1. B
2. D
3. A
4. C
5. B
6. B
7. C
8. D
9. B
10. D

True/False:
1. A
2. B
3. B
4. A

Free-response:
1. Sedimentation can preserve fossils by covering them with layers of sediment, protecting them from decay and erosion.
2. Water, wind, and ice are all natural forces that can contribute to erosion and sedimentation.
3. Sedimentation is the gradual accumulation of sediment on the Earth's surface. As natural forces transport sediments and they settle in areas of low energy, layers are formed over time. These layers can be studied to gather information about past environments and events.
