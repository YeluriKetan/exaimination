10. Gravity is a force of attraction between objects with mass. As stated in Newton’s law of gravitation, the force of gravity is directly proportional to the masses of the objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This means that the more massive an object is, the stronger its gravitational pull. In the case of our solar system, the sun’s massive size results in a strong gravitational pull, causing all the planets to be continuously pulled towards it. However, the planets also have their own velocity, which creates a balance between the gravitational pull and the planet’s velocity, resulting in an elliptical orbit around the sun. This can also be explained by Kepler’s laws of planetary motion, which describe the shape and speed of planetary orbits. Overall, gravity is the fundamental force that governs the complex motions of planets in our solar system.
