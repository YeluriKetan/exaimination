13. The structure of a typical virus consists of genetic material (DNA or RNA) surrounded by a protein coat called a capsid. Some viruses also have an outer envelope made of lipids taken from the host cell.
14. Viruses infect host cells by attaching to specific receptors on the cell surface, injecting their genetic material into the cell, and taking over the cell's machinery to produce more viral particles.
15. AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and has had a significant impact on society, particularly in the development of medical treatments and public health policies.
