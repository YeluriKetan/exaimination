Free-response:
1. The two main categories of celestial bodies are planets and stars. Planets are large, spherical objects that orbit around a star. Stars are massive luminous objects that generate their own light and heat.
2. Constellations are patterns formed by stars in the sky. They are formed when humans connect the stars together to create recognizable shapes or figures.
3. Astronomers gather information about objects in space by using tools such as telescopes, spectroscopes, and radio telescopes. They also study data and images gathered from space missions and satellites.
4. Studying Astronomy is important because it allows us to gain a better understanding of our place in the universe and the vastness of space. It also helps us learn about the origins of our solar system and the possibility of life on other planets.
