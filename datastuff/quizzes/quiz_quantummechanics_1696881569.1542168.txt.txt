C. A wave-like state at all times
D. No states at all

7. True/False: The principles of quantum mechanics have had no impact on modern technology.
A. True
B. False

8. The Schrödinger equation is used to describe:
A. Quantum tunneling
B. Wave-particle duality
C. Superposition
D. The behavior of quantum systems

9. The concept of probability is important in quantum mechanics because:
A. It allows for precise measurements of particles
B. It predicts the exact location of a particle
C. The behavior of particles is not deterministic
D. It disproves the uncertainty principle

10. Free-response: Choose one key concept or principle in quantum mechanics and explain it in your own words.

Answer: The uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously know the precise position and momentum of a particle. This is because the act of measuring one property affects the other, making it impossible to have complete knowledge about both. This principle highlights the probabilistic nature of particles and the limitations of our ability to observe and measure them.
