8. D
9. D
10. B
True/False:
1. False
2. False
3. False
4. False
Free-Response:
1. Low-mass stars spend the majority of their lifetime on the main sequence, while high-mass stars have a more violent life cycle, quickly using up their hydrogen fuel and moving on to fuse heavier elements.
2. Studying the life cycle of stars helps us understand the formation of planets and the evolution of the universe. By studying the remains of old stars, we can also gain insights into the composition and history of our own solar system.
3. The stage of a star's life is determined by its mass. Low-mass stars will spend more time on the main sequence, while high-mass stars will evolve more quickly and eventually explode in a supernova. This affects the elements present in a star and its ultimate fate.
