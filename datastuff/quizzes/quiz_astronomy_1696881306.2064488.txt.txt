15. How do irregular galaxies form and how are they classified?

Answer key:
1. A) Gravity
2. C) Spiral
3. A) Young, hot stars
4. B) Elliptical
5. A) Supermassive black hole
6. A) Interactions with other galaxies
7. B) Irregular
8. D) They have a higher rate of star formation
9. A) Their formation and evolution
10. A) True
11. B) False
12. B) False
13. B) False
14. Spiral galaxies have a central bulge and spiral arms, while elliptical galaxies have a round or oval shape and no distinct arms or bulge. Spiral galaxies also tend to have more ongoing star formation compared to elliptical galaxies.
15. Irregular galaxies can form from interactions with other galaxies or disruptions caused by gravitational forces. They can be classified as dwarf irregular galaxies, which are smaller in size and have lower rates of star formation.
