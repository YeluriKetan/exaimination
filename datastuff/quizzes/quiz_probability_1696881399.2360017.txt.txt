1) Which branch of mathematics deals with the likelihood of events occurring?
A) Geometry
B) Algebra
C) Probability
D) Trigonometry

2) What is the main purpose of probability?
A) To predict the outcomes of certain events
B) To study shapes and figures
C) To analyze historical data
D) To solve equations

3) Theoretical probability is based on:
A) Actual data
B) Mathematical calculations
C) Random chance
D) Predictions

4) What is experimental probability based on?
A) Data collected from experiments
B) Theoretical calculations
C) Random guesses
D) Past experiences

5) A probability tree diagram shows:
A) The most likely outcome of an event
B) The least likely outcome of an event
C) All possible outcomes and their probabilities
D) Impossible outcomes

6) Independent events are events that:
A) Do not affect each other
B) Always occur together
C) Have opposite outcomes
D) Are impossible to predict

7) Dependent events are events that:
A) Are impossible to predict
B) Do not affect each other
C) Have opposite outcomes
D) Affect each other's outcomes

8) Probability can be applied to:
A) Weather prediction
B) Stock market trends
C) Both A and B
D) Neither A nor B

9) True or False: Understanding probability is not important in real-life situations.
A) True
B) False

10) Free-response: Give an example of a dependent event and explain why it is considered dependent.

Answer: Drawing two cards from a deck without replacement is a dependent event because the probability of drawing the second card will be affected by the first card drawn. For example, if the first card drawn is a King, the probability of drawing another King will decrease since there is now one less King in the deck.
