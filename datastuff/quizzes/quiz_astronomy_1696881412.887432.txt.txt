9. True or False: The main sequence phase is the longest stage in a star's life cycle.
A. True
B. False

10. True or False: Larger stars have a shorter life span compared to smaller stars.
A. True
B. False

11. Free-response: What determines the fate of a star after it has run out of fuel? 

Answer: The mass of the star determines its fate. Smaller stars will become white dwarfs, while larger stars will explode in a supernova.

12. Free-response: Why is understanding the life cycle of stars important in studying the universe?

Answer: Understanding the life cycle of stars helps us understand the physical processes and conditions that govern celestial bodies. It also provides insights into the creation of the universe and the formation of new stars. 

13. Free-response: Can a star live indefinitely in the main sequence phase?

Answer: No, eventually all stars will run out of fuel and move on to the next stage in their life cycle. The length of time spent in the main sequence phase depends on the mass of the star.
