13. Cellular respiration is the process by which cells convert food molecules into energy that can be used for cellular functions. It consists of three main steps: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain.
14. Aerobic respiration requires oxygen and is more efficient, producing a larger amount of ATP. Anaerobic respiration does not require oxygen and produces a smaller amount of ATP.
15. Cellular respiration is important for living organisms because it provides the necessary energy for cellular functions. Without it, cells would not be able to perform essential processes such as growth, repair, and reproduction.
