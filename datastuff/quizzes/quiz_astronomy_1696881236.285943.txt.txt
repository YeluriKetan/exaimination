11. A telescope is an instrument that collects and focuses light to magnify distant objects in the night sky. It works by using lenses or mirrors to gather light and then focus it onto a small area for observation.
12. One important discovery made through the study of astronomy is the heliocentric model of the solar system, which states that the Sun is at the center and the planets revolve around it.
13. Spectroscopy is a technique used in astronomy that analyzes the light emitted or absorbed by an object to determine its chemical composition and temperature. This helps astronomers gather information about the physical properties of celestial objects and understand their origins and evolution.
