11. Superposition is the ability of a particle to exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is measured. This is a key aspect of quantum entanglement where the state of one particle is not determined until the other is measured.
12. One real-world application of quantum entanglement is quantum cryptography, which uses the inseparable connection between particles to ensure secure communication.
13. Quantum entanglement challenges our classical understanding of cause and effect because it suggests that two particles can be connected at a distance, and the state of one particle can be affected by the state of the other instantaneously, regardless of the distance between them. This goes against our classical understanding that cause and effect occur in a sequential and distance-dependent manner.
