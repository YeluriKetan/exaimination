True/False:
1. Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that allow communication between neurons in the brain. (True)
2. Glutamate is an inhibitory neurotransmitter. (False)
3. Acetylcholine is involved in the formation of new memories. (True)
4. Repeated stimulation of the same pathway leads to the formation of new synapses. (True)

8. B

True/False:
1. True
2. False
3. True
4. True

Free-response:
1. Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that allow communication between neurons in the brain. When an individual learns something new, specific neurotransmitters are released to strengthen the connections between neurons. This process is known as long-term potentiation.
2. Acetylcholine is involved in the formation of new memories, particularly spatial and episodic memory. Disruptions in acetylcholine signaling can impair memory consolidation and retrieval.
3. At a synapse, an action potential causes the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, triggering a response that leads to changes in the strength of the connection between neurons, ultimately resulting in the formation of a new memory.
