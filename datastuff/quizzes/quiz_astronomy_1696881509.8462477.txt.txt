1. True
2. False
3. False
4. True

1. Elliptical galaxies are usually rounded and flattened, while spiral galaxies have more defined spiral arms.
2. Some possible explanations for low star formation in elliptical galaxies include the lack of gas and dust for new star formation, as well as the older age of the stars in these galaxies.
3. The composition of gas and dust in a galaxy can affect the rate of star formation by providing the necessary materials for new stars to form. Different amounts and types of gas and dust can also impact the size and location of star-forming regions within a galaxy.
