Free-Response:
1. An example of mutualism in marine environments is the relationship between coral and zooxanthellae. Coral provides a protected environment for the zooxanthellae to live and in return, the zooxanthellae provide nutrients and energy through photosynthesis for the coral.

2. Mutualism is when both species involved benefit from the interaction, commensalism is when one species benefits while the other is neither harmed nor helped, and parasitism is when one species benefits at the expense of the other.

3. Understanding symbiotic relationships is important in studying the intricate web of life in the ocean and how different species depend on each other for survival. It also highlights the importance of preserving and protecting these relationships for the health and balance of marine ecosystems.
