Answer Key:
MCQs:
1) c) Lake
2) b) Astronomy
3) b) Egyptians
4) b) Telescopes
5) c) Celestial coordinates
6) d) Right ascension
7) d) All of the above

True/False:
1) True
2) True
3) False
4) False

Free-response:
1) Astronomers can use the spectrum emitted by matter falling into a black hole to gather information about its mass and properties.
2) The celestial coordinate system uses declination and right ascension to locate objects in the sky.
3) Black holes have such strong gravitational pull that not even light can escape from them, making it difficult for astronomers to study them.
