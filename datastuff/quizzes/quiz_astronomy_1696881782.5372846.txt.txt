Free-Response:
1. The seven main spectral types of stars are O, B, A, F, G, K, and M, with O being the hottest and M being the coolest.
2. The more massive a star is, the hotter and brighter it will be because the increased mass allows for more fusion reactions to occur in the core, creating a greater amount of energy.
3. Measuring luminosity in terms of solar luminosity allows for a standardized comparison between stars and their energy output.
4. Understanding the different types of stars is crucial in studying the universe and its evolution, as it helps us understand the diversity and complexity of the universe. It also allows us to make predictions and discoveries about the universe.
