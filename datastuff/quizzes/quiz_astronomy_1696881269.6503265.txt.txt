10) Free-Response: How does gravity play a role in the movement and formation of objects in the universe?

Answer: Gravity is the force that pulls objects towards each other. In the universe, this force is responsible for the formation of planets, stars, and galaxies. It also plays a crucial role in the movement and orbits of these objects. For example, the planets in our solar system are held in orbit around the sun by the sun's gravitational pull. Gravity also helps to keep galaxies together and controls the movement of stars within them.
