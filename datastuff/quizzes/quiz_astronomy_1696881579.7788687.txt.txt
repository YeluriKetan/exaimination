True/False:
1. The celestial poles are the points where the Earth's axis intersects with the celestial sphere. 
2. The celestial equator is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees. 
3. The ecliptic is an imaginary line that divides the celestial sphere into eastern and western hemispheres.
4. The heliocentric model shows the Sun at the center of the solar system.

Free Response:
1. Compare and contrast the geocentric and heliocentric models.
2. How are the celestial equator and the Earth's equator related?

True/False:
1. True
2. False
3. False
4. True

Free Response:
1. The geocentric model has the Earth at the center of the solar system, while the heliocentric model has the Sun at the center. Both models were used in history to explain the motions of planets, but the heliocentric model is now widely accepted as the accurate model.
2. The celestial equator is the projection of the Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere. This means that they are in the same plane and have the same tilt of 23.5 degrees.
3. Modern technology and space exploration, such as telescopes and satellites, have allowed us to observe and study objects in the universe that were previously unknown or inaccessible. This has led to new discoveries and a deeper understanding of the complex universe.
