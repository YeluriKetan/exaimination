True/False:
1. True
2. False
3. True
4. False

Free-response:
1. A rock is a solid combination of minerals or other materials, while a mineral is a naturally occurring, inorganic substance with a specific chemical composition and crystal structure.
2. Geologists use field observations to gather data and samples from the Earth's surface, while laboratory analyses allow them to further analyze and identify these samples.
3. An example of a geologic hazard is an earthquake. Geologists study the location and direction of fault lines to predict potential earthquakes and their magnitude. They also study the Earth's crust and use seismographs to monitor any shifts or movements in the Earth's surface.
