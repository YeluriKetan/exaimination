Free-response: 
1) Short-term memory has a limited capacity and holds information for a short period of time, while long-term memory has a larger storage capacity and stores information for longer periods of time. 
2) Encoding is the process of taking in new information and transforming it into a form that can be stored in the brain. 
3) By understanding how learning and memory work, individuals can develop effective learning strategies and improve their memory recall, leading to better academic success.
