Answer Key:
MCQs: 1) A, 2) A, 3) D, 4) C, 5) A, 6) B, 7) B, 8) A 
True/False: 1) B, 2) B, 3) A, 4) B 
Free-response:
1) Quantum entanglement challenges our understanding of classical physics because it goes against the principle that an object can only be influenced by its immediate surroundings. This phenomenon allows for a connection between two particles regardless of distance, which contradicts the concept of locality in classical physics.
2) The EPR paradox involves two entangled particles, A and B, separated by a large distance. When a measurement is made on particle A, it will instantly affect the state of particle B, even if they are light years apart. This paradox showed that there must be a connection between the two particles, leading to the theory of quantum entanglement.
3) Other potential applications for quantum entanglement include secure communication techniques using entangled particles, improved precision in measurements, and the potential for quantum teleportation of information.
