2. Understanding motivation helps us gain insight into human behavior by providing a framework to understand why people behave in certain ways. It also helps us understand the factors that influence behavior and how we can effectively motivate ourselves and others.
3. Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a theory that suggests motivation is driven by a hierarchy of needs, with the most basic physiological needs at the bottom and self-actualization needs at the top. This means that individuals must fulfill their basic needs such as food, shelter, and safety before they can focus on higher level needs such as self-esteem and personal growth. This has implications on how we understand and motivate human behavior.
