True/False:
1. Plate Tectonics is the theory that explains the movements of the Earth's oceans. (False)
2. The Earth's lithosphere includes the crust and lower portion of the mantle. (False)
3. Divergent boundaries result in the creation of underwater mountain ranges. (True)
4. Continental plates can subduct beneath oceanic plates. (False)

Free-response:
1. How is seafloor spreading related to the theory of Plate Tectonics?
2. Describe the different types of plate boundaries and the geological features associated with each.
3. In what ways does Plate Tectonics impact the Earth's surface and natural phenomena?

Answer Key:
MCQs: 1. C, 2. A, 3. A, 4. A, 5. A, 6. B, 7. B, 8. B, 9. C, 10. D
True/False: 1. False, 2. False, 3. True, 4. False
Free-response:
1. Seafloor spreading is the process of creating new oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges. This is related to Plate Tectonics because it is evidence of the movement of tectonic plates.
2. Divergent boundaries result in the creation of new crust, transform boundaries result in earthquakes, and convergent boundaries can result in mountain ranges or deep ocean trenches.
3. Plate Tectonics impacts the Earth's surface by causing natural disasters such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. It also plays a role in the formation of mountains and other geological features.
