True/False:
1. False
2. False
3. True
4. True

Free-response:
1. Spiral galaxies have a disk-like shape with arms spiraling outwards, while irregular galaxies have a distorted and irregular shape. Spiral galaxies also have a central bulge, while irregular galaxies do not.
2. Astronomers classify galaxies based on their shape, size, composition, and observed characteristics such as rate of star formation.
3. Some possible explanations for the different types of galaxies include gravitational interactions with other galaxies, internal processes within the galaxy, and the age and composition of the stars within the galaxy.
