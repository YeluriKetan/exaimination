Free-Response:

1. Explain the role of gravity in the formation and movement of celestial bodies.

Gravity is one of the fundamental concepts in Astronomy and plays a crucial role in the formation and movement of celestial bodies. According to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force that is directly proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This means that the larger the mass of an object, the stronger its gravitational pull, and the farther away an object is, the weaker the gravitational pull. This force of gravity is what keeps planets in orbit around the sun and holds galaxies together. Without gravity, objects in the universe would not be able to maintain their orbits or stay together, and the universe as we know it would be drastically different.
