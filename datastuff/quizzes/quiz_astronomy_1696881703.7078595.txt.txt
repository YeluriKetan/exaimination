Free-response:
1. The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is a graph that plots stars based on their luminosity (brightness) and temperature. It allows astronomers to categorize stars into different groups, such as main sequence, red giants, and white dwarfs.
2. The three main types of galaxies are spiral, elliptical, and irregular. Spiral galaxies have a spiral-like structure and contain mostly young stars. Elliptical galaxies are round or oval-shaped and contain mostly old stars. Irregular galaxies do not have a defined shape and contain both young and old stars.
3. The transit method involves monitoring the dimming of a star's light as a planet passes in front of it. The radial velocity method measures the wobble of a star caused by the gravitational pull of a planet. Gravitational lensing occurs when the gravity of a planet bends the light of a star behind it, making it appear brighter. Supernova detection involves looking for the changes in brightness of a star, which could indicate the presence of a planet.
