Answer key:
1. c
2. a
3. c
4. c
5. b
6. a
7. a
8. c
9. b
10. d

Free-response questions:
1. The first step of photosynthesis is the absorption of light energy by chlorophyll, which is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The second step is the Calvin cycle, where hydrogen is combined with carbon dioxide to produce glucose.
2. Photosynthesis benefits the Earth's ecosystem by producing oxygen, which is essential for sustaining life, and by providing a food source for other organisms in the food chain.
3. The inputs of photosynthesis are water and carbon dioxide, while the outputs are oxygen and glucose.
