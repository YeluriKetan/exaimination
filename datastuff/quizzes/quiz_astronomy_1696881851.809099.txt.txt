True/False: 1. True 2. False 3. False 4. True 
Free-response: 1. The four types of galaxies are spiral, elliptical, irregular, and dwarf. Spiral galaxies have spiral arms and a central bulge, elliptical galaxies are smooth and oval-shaped, irregular galaxies lack a defined shape, and dwarf galaxies are smaller and dim compared to other types. 
2. The study of galaxies is important because it helps us understand the structure and evolution of the universe. By studying their shapes, sizes, and movements, we can piece together the history of the cosmos. 
3. The main difference between spiral and elliptical galaxies is their shape and composition. Spiral galaxies have spiral arms and contain gas and dust, while elliptical galaxies are smooth and contain mainly old stars and little to no gas or dust. 
4. Irregular galaxies can form through gravitational interactions with other galaxies or intense star formation. 
5. Advancements in technology such as telescopes and satellites have helped us discover new galaxies by allowing us to observe and study them in greater detail.
