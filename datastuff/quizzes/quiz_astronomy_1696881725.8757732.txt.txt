13. Nuclear fusion is important in star formation because it is the process that generates energy and light in stars, allowing them to shine and sustain themselves.
14. Gravity plays a crucial role in the formation of planets as it causes material in the protoplanetary disk to clump together and form larger objects, eventually leading to the formation of planets.
15. Studying star and planet formation can give us insight into the diversity of planetary systems in our galaxy by showing us the different factors that influence the size and composition of planets, such as distance from the star, mass, and orbit. It also allows us to compare and contrast different planetary systems to better understand the overall formation process.
