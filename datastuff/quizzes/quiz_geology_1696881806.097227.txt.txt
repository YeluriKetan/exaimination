Free-response:
1. Sedimentary rocks are formed through the process of weathering, erosion, and deposition. First, weathering breaks down existing rocks into smaller pieces. Then, these pieces are transported by water, wind, or ice and eventually deposited in layers. Over time, these layers become compacted and cemented together, forming sedimentary rocks.
2. The Earth's internal heat contributes to the rock cycle by driving processes such as melting, cooling, and recrystallization. Without this heat, the rock cycle would not be able to continue.
3. Intrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma that cools and solidifies deep underground, while extrusive igneous rocks are formed from lava that cools and solidifies on the Earth's surface. Intrusive rocks have larger crystals due to slower cooling, while extrusive rocks have smaller crystals due to rapid cooling.
