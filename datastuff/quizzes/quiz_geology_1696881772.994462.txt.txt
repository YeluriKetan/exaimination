Free-response:
1. One tool used by geologists to identify and classify minerals is conducting physical and chemical tests, such as hardness, cleavage, and reaction to acid.
2. Igneous rocks are formed from molten magma or lava, sedimentary rocks are made of sediment that has been compacted and cemented together, and metamorphic rocks are formed from preexisting rocks that have been changed by heat and pressure.
3. Understanding the formation of rocks and minerals helps geologists to understand the Earth's history, processes, and resources, and also to predict and manage natural hazards.
