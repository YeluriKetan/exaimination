Answer: False

Free-Response:
1. Describe the process of star formation.
Answer: Star formation occurs when vast clouds of gas and dust, known as nebulae, collapse under their own gravity. As the nebulae collapse, the temperature and pressure at the center increase, triggering nuclear fusion reactions. These reactions generate enormous amounts of energy, causing the nebulae to light up and form a protostar. As the protostar continues to grow, it becomes denser and hotter until it reaches a critical point and begins to shine as a star.

2. What are the different types of stars and how are they classified?
Answer: The different types of stars are red dwarfs, red giants, and supergiants. Stars are classified based on their spectral type, which is determined by their surface temperature. The most common spectral types are O, B, A, F, G, K, and M. Red dwarfs have masses less than half that of our sun and are cooler and have longer lifespans. Red giants have masses two to eight times that of our sun and are hotter and have shorter lifespans. Supergiants have masses over eight times that of our sun and are the brightest and hottest stars in the universe. Our sun is a G-type star, which has a surface temperature of about 5,500 degrees Celsius.
