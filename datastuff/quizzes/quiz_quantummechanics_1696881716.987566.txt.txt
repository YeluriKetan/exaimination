12. The wave-particle duality concept states that particles, such as electrons, can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior. This means that particles can behave like waves, with properties such as diffraction and interference, but can also behave like discrete, localized particles with specific positions and momentums.
13. Superposition is the concept that states a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is observed or measured. This is important in quantum mechanics because it allows for the understanding of how particles behave and interact with each other on a subatomic level.
14. One real-life application of quantum mechanics is the development of transistors, which are essential components in electronic devices such as computers and smartphones. The understanding of quantum mechanics led to the development of miniaturized transistors, allowing for the advancement of technology and the digital age.
