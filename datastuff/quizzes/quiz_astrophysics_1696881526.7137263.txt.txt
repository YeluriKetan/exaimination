c) Planetary motion
d) Mergers with other galaxies

10) Free-response: Describe the hierarchical model for galaxy formation.

11) Free-response: How is the evolution of galaxies different from their formation?

12) Free-response: What role does gravity play in the formation and evolution of galaxies?

Answer Key: 
1) b) Gravity
2) c) Spiral
3) a) Hierarchical model
4) c) Gravity
5) a) Early
6) a) Evolution
7) a) Gas accretion
8) b) False
9) c) Planetary motion
10) The hierarchical model suggests that smaller structures merge over time to form larger structures, eventually leading to the formation of galaxies.
11) The formation of galaxies is a process of merging smaller structures, while the evolution of galaxies involves factors such as gas accretion, star formation, and mergers with other galaxies.
12) Gravity is the driving force behind the formation of galaxies, as each structure attracts and pulls in neighboring structures. It also plays a role in the evolution of galaxies, influencing factors such as gas accretion and mergers with other galaxies.
