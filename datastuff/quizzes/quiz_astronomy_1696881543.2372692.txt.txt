Free-Response:

1. Explain the process of protostar formation.

2. What is the main sequence stage and how long does it typically last?

3. What happens to low-mass stars during the red giant phase?

Answer Key:
1. C
2. A
3. B
4. A
5. C
6. B
7. B
True/False:
1. A (True)
2. B (False)
3. B (False)
4. A (True)
Free-Response:
1. Protostar formation is the process by which a massive cloud of gas and dust called a nebula collapses under its own gravity, causing the gas and dust to become more compact and heat up.
2. The main sequence stage is the longest and most stable stage in a star's life, during which the star maintains its size and luminosity by balancing the inward pull of gravity with the outward pressure of nuclear fusion. The duration of this stage depends on the mass of the star, with smaller stars lasting for billions of years and larger stars burning through their hydrogen fuel at a faster rate.
3. Low-mass stars will gradually lose their outer layers, forming a planetary nebula, and the remaining core will become a white dwarf.
