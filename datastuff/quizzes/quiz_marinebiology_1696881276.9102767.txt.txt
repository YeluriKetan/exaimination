11. Marine mammals contribute to the ocean ecosystem by playing roles as top predators, helping to maintain balance in food webs, and providing nutrients through their waste. They also help to regulate the populations of their prey, preventing overgrazing of marine plant life.
12. Adaptations of marine mammals include blubber for insulation, flippers for swimming, and the ability to hold their breath for extended periods of time.
13. Human activities such as pollution, overfishing, and noise pollution can negatively impact marine mammals. We can help protect them by reducing our use of single-use plastics, supporting sustainable fishing practices, and limiting noise pollution in their habitats.
