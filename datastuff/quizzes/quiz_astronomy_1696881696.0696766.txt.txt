B. False

Free-Response:
10. What is the event horizon of a black hole and how does it affect objects and time?
11. Why are black holes an important area of study in astronomy?
12. How does the size of a black hole relate to its mass?

Answer Key:
1. B
2. A
3. A
4. B
5. A
6. B
7. B
8. A
9. A
10. The event horizon of a black hole is the point of no return where the gravitational pull is too strong for anything to escape. Time near the event horizon moves slower, and objects appear to slow down and freeze as they approach it.
11. Black holes are important in studying the laws of gravity and the nature of space and time.
12. The size of a black hole is determined by its mass, with more massive black holes having larger sizes.
