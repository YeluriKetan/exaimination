Free-response:
1) Clastic sedimentary rocks are formed from pieces of pre-existing rocks and minerals that have been weathered and transported to a new location. Chemical sedimentary rocks are formed from dissolved minerals in water that precipitate out and solidify, while organic sedimentary rocks are formed from the remains of once-living organisms. These processes take place over thousands or even millions of years.
2) Geologists use sedimentary rocks to understand the history of Earth by examining their composition, layering, and fossil content. This can provide clues about past environments and life forms, helping to piece together a timeline of Earth's history.
3) Examples of organic sedimentary rocks include coal, formed from compacted plant material, and limestone, which can contain fossilized shells or other marine organisms. These rocks are formed when the remains of once-living organisms are compacted and cemented together over time.
