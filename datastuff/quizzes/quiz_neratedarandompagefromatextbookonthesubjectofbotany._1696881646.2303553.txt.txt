Free-response:
1. Understanding the structure of plants is important because it helps with proper care and cultivation, as well as identifying and classifying different species.
2. Leaves are responsible for photosynthesis, which is how plants produce energy. They also have specialized structures, such as stomata, that help regulate gas exchange and allow for optimal photosynthesis.
3. Flowers attract pollinators through their size, shape, and color, as well as by producing nectar and scent that attract animals.
4. One sub-discipline of botany is plant physiology, which focuses on the internal workings and functions of plants.
