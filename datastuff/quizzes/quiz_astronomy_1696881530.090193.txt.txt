Free-response:
1. The size and mass of a star determine the amount of fuel it has and how long it will last. Smaller stars will have longer lifespans, while larger stars will burn through their fuel more quickly. A star's fate is determined by its mass - smaller stars will eventually become white dwarfs, while larger stars will become supernovae and may form either a neutron star or a black hole.
2. Understanding the evolution of stars allows us to understand the life cycle of a star and the processes that shape the universe. It also provides insights into the formation of planets and the potential for life in other solar systems.
3. Nuclear fusion is the process of combining two or more atomic nuclei to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a large amount of energy in the process. In stars, this energy is what keeps them shining and provides the necessary conditions for life to form. As hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium, the released energy counteracts the force of gravity, preventing the star from collapsing.
