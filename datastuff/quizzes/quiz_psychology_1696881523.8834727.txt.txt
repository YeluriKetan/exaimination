1. In classical conditioning, the conditioned stimulus is a previously neutral stimulus that, after being repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus, triggers a conditioned response. The unconditioned stimulus is a stimulus that naturally and automatically triggers a response without any prior learning.
2. Operant conditioning can be used in a classroom setting by using a system of rewards and punishments to shape behavior. For example, a teacher may give a student a sticker for completing their homework on time, which serves as a reward and increases the likelihood of the student completing their homework on time in the future.
3. Attention is important in observational learning because if an individual is not paying attention to the model's behavior, they will not be able to imitate it. Attention allows for the individual to focus on the key aspects of the behavior and retain it for future use.
