15. Explain the three key elements of operant conditioning.
Answer: The three key elements of operant conditioning are the behavior, the consequence, and the reinforcement schedule. The behavior is the action or response of an individual, the consequence is the outcome of the behavior (either positive or negative), and the reinforcement schedule refers to the pattern or frequency in which the consequences are delivered.

16. Give an example of a fixed ratio schedule.
Answer: A fixed ratio schedule is when reinforcement is delivered after a set number of behaviors. An example of this is a salesperson receiving a bonus for every 10 products they sell.

17. How does operant conditioning play a role in parenting?
Answer: Operant conditioning can play a role in parenting by using positive reinforcement to encourage desired behaviors and negative consequences (such as taking away privileges) to discourage unwanted behaviors. This can shape a child's behavior and increase the likelihood of them repeating desired behaviors in the future.
