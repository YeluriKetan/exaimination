a) It is a hot, dense core of a star
b) It is a small, cool star
c) It is a small, hot star
d) It is a large, cool star

8) True or False: A white dwarf will eventually fade away into a black hole.
a) True
b) False

9) What happens to a star's gravity as it runs out of fuel in its core?

d) It disappears

10) Free-Response: Describe the main sequence phase of a star's life.
Answer: The main sequence phase is the longest phase in a star's life where it is in a stable state, fusing hydrogen atoms in its core to form helium. The release of energy from this fusion creates an outward pressure that balances the star's gravity, keeping it in a stable state.

True/False:
1) Gravity is the main force that holds a star together.
Answer: True
2) All stars go through the same stages in their life cycle.
Answer: False
3) A planetary nebula is formed when a star explodes.
Answer: False
4) A red giant is smaller and cooler than a white dwarf.
Answer: False
