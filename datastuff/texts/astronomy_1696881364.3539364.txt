Content: Our solar system is made up of eight planets, each with their own unique characteristics. The four inner planets - Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars - are known as the terrestrial planets. They are relatively small, rocky, and have solid surfaces. The outer planets - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune - are known as gas giants. They are much larger in size and composed mostly of gases such as hydrogen and helium. Beyond Neptune, there is a region called the Kuiper Belt, which contains dwarf planets, comets, and other small bodies. This region extends outwards to the Oort Cloud, which is believed to be the origin of most comets. The study of our solar system and the objects within it is known as astronomy. Through telescopes, spacecraft, and other advanced technology, scientists continue to discover new information about our solar system and the vast universe beyond it.
