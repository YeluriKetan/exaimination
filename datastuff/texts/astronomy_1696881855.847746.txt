Topic: The Life Cycle of Stars
Stars are the most fascinating objects in the universe. They are massive, luminous balls of gas that emit enormous amounts of energy. But have you ever wondered how they come into existence and what happens to them over time? In this chapter, we will explore the life cycle of stars and how they evolve and change over billions of years.

Formation of Stars:
Stars begin their lives as clouds of gas and dust, known as nebulae. These clouds are made up of mostly hydrogen and helium, the two lightest elements in the universe. Under the influence of gravity, these clouds start to collapse and become denser and hotter. As the temperature and pressure increase, nuclear fusion reactions begin at the core, and a new star is born.

Main Sequence Stars:
The majority of stars, including our Sun, fall into the category of main sequence stars. These stars spend most of their lives burning hydrogen fuel in their core, which produces energy through nuclear fusion. The outward pressure from this energy balances the inward force of gravity, keeping the star in a stable state. The size and the color of the star depend on its mass, with larger stars being hotter and more luminous.

Red Giants and Supergiants:
As a main sequence star starts to run out of hydrogen fuel, it begins to swell up and become a red giant. These stars are much larger and cooler than they were during their main sequence phase. As they continue to evolve, they may become supergiants, the largest and most luminous stars in the universe.

Planetary Nebulae and White Dwarfs:
Eventually, the outer layers of a red giant or supergiant are ejected, leaving behind a hot, dense core called a white dwarf. This is the final stage of life for low to medium mass stars. The ejected material forms a beautiful glowing cloud known as a planetary nebulae. The white dwarf will continue to cool over billions of years until it becomes a black dwarf, which is essentially a dead star.

Supernovae and Neutron Stars:
In more massive stars, after the red giant or supergiant phase, the core will continue to collapse under its own gravity. This sudden collapse can trigger a supernova explosion, where the star briefly becomes one of the brightest objects in the universe. What's left behind is either a neutron star or a black hole
