Content: This chapter focuses on the formation of different types of rocks. Rocks are classified into three main categories: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. These rock types are formed through various processes that occur within the Earth's crust.

Igneous rocks are formed from molten magma or lava that cools and solidifies. This can happen either on the Earth's surface, forming extrusive igneous rocks, or deep underground, forming intrusive igneous rocks. Examples of igneous rocks include granite, basalt, and pumice.

Sedimentary rocks are formed through the process of weathering, erosion, and deposition. Weathering breaks down existing rocks into smaller pieces, which are then transported by water, wind, or ice and deposited in layers. Over time, these layers become compacted and cemented together, forming sedimentary rocks. Examples of sedimentary rocks include sandstone, shale, and limestone.

Metamorphic rocks are formed when existing rocks are subjected to extreme heat and pressure. This causes the minerals within the rocks to recrystallize, forming new rocks with different physical and chemical properties. Examples of metamorphic rocks include marble, slate, and gneiss.

The rock cycle is a continuous process where rocks are constantly changing from one type to another. This process is driven by the Earth's internal heat and external forces such as weathering and erosion. Understanding the rock cycle is essential in studying the Earth's history and its processes.
