On page 87, we will be discussing the concept of operant conditioning in psychology. This theory, developed by B.F. Skinner, explains how behavior can be influenced by consequences or rewards.

According to operant conditioning, behaviors that are rewarded are more likely to be repeated, while behaviors that are punished are less likely to be repeated. This can be seen in everyday life, such as a child receiving a candy for completing their chores, leading to them being more likely to do their chores in the future.

There are four key components to operant conditioning: positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, positive punishment, and negative punishment. Positive reinforcement involves giving a pleasant stimulus after a behavior to increase the likelihood of that behavior being repeated. An example of this can be seen when a student receives a sticker for answering a question correctly in class.

Negative reinforcement involves removing an unpleasant stimulus after a behavior to increase the likelihood of that behavior being repeated. For instance, a person may put on sunscreen to avoid getting sunburnt, thus increasing the likelihood of them applying sunscreen in the future.

Positive punishment involves giving an unpleasant stimulus after a behavior to decrease the likelihood of that behavior being repeated. An example of this is a child being scolded for hitting their sibling, which may decrease the likelihood of them hitting their sibling in the future.

Negative punishment involves removing a pleasant stimulus after a behavior to decrease the likelihood of that behavior being repeated. A common example of this is taking away a child's toy as a consequence for misbehaving.

Overall, operant conditioning plays a significant role in shaping our behaviors and can be observed in various aspects of our lives. Understanding this concept can help us better understand why we behave the way we do and how we can shape our behavior through reinforcement and punishment.
