Content: On this page, we will discuss the concept of stellar evolution. Stellar evolution is the process by which stars change over time, from their formation until their eventual death. It is a fundamental concept in astronomy and can help us understand the nature of our universe.

The first stage of stellar evolution is the formation of a protostar. This occurs when a large cloud of gas and dust collapses due to its own gravity. As the material becomes more compact, the temperature and pressure at the center increase, eventually leading to nuclear fusion. This fusion of hydrogen atoms creates the energy that allows the star to shine.

As the star continues to burn fuel, it will enter different stages of its life depending on its mass. For low-mass stars like our Sun, the next stage is the main sequence, where it will spend the majority of its life. During this stage, the outward radiation pressure from nuclear fusion balances the inward pull of gravity, creating a stable equilibrium.

As the star exhausts its hydrogen fuel, it will enter the red giant phase. In this stage, the outer layers of the star will expand and cool, while the core continues to fuse helium into heavier elements. Eventually, the outer layers will be shed, leaving behind a small, hot core known as a white dwarf.

For higher mass stars, the end of their lives is more dramatic. They will go through several stages, including red supergiant and supernova, before collapsing into a neutron star or black hole.

Understanding stellar evolution is crucial in our study of the universe, as it allows us to trace the path of a star from its birth to its death. Furthermore, it can help us understand the elements that make up our world, as they are created through the fusion processes in stars.
