In this section, we will be discussing the formation of our solar system. Our solar system consists of the Sun and all the objects that orbit around it, including planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. But how did it all come to be?

Scientists believe that the solar system formed from a large, rotating cloud of gas and dust known as a nebula. As the nebula collapsed under its own gravity, it began to spin faster and flatten into a disk shape. The center of the disk became increasingly dense and hot, eventually forming the Sun.

Meanwhile, the remaining material in the disk began to clump together due to gravity. These clumps, called planetesimals, collided and merged to form larger objects, eventually becoming the planets we know today. The inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, are made mostly of rock and metal, while the outer planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, are primarily composed of gas and ice.

As the planets formed, they cleared out the remaining material in their orbits, leaving behind smaller objects such as asteroids and comets. These objects can still be found in our solar system today, providing valuable information about its early formation.

This diagram shows the different stages of our solar system's formation, from the collapsing nebula to the formation of planets and smaller objects.

As we continue to study and learn more about our solar system, we gain a better understanding of our place in the universe and the vastness of space.
