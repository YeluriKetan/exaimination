The universe is a vast and mysterious place, filled with countless stars, planets, and other celestial objects. In this chapter, we will explore the structure of our solar system and the various bodies that inhabit it.

At the center of our solar system is the Sun, a massive ball of gas and plasma that provides light and heat to all the planets and other objects orbiting around it. The Sun makes up nearly 99.9% of the mass of our solar system, with the remaining 0.1% belonging to the planets, asteroids, comets, and other objects.

The four inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, are known as the terrestrial planets due to their similar composition of rocky surfaces and dense cores. They are also the closest to the Sun, with Mercury being the closest and Mars being the farthest.

Moving outward, we encounter the four gas giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These planets are much larger than the terrestrial planets and are made up mainly of hydrogen and helium gas. Their atmospheres are constantly changing and are filled with swirling storms and colorful bands.

Beyond the gas giants, we find the Kuiper Belt, a region of small icy objects that extends beyond the orbit of Neptune. This is also where we can find dwarf planets such as Pluto and Eris.

Finally, at the edge of our solar system lies the Oort Cloud, a vast region of comets and other icy bodies that extends far beyond the Kuiper Belt. While it is still largely a mystery, the Oort Cloud is believed to be the source of long-period comets that occasionally visit the inner solar system.

Diagrams depicting the structure of our solar system and the distances between the planets can be found on this page for reference. Understanding the composition and arrangement of our solar system is crucial in studying the universe and its many wonders.
