Content: On this page, we will be discussing the different types of galaxies that exist in our universe. Galaxies are massive systems of stars, gas, and dust held together by gravity. They come in various shapes and sizes, each with its own unique characteristics. 

The three main types of galaxies are spiral, elliptical, and irregular. Spiral galaxies, as the name suggests, have a distinct spiral shape with a central bulge and arms that extend outwards. They are further classified into two subtypes, barred and unbarred, depending on the presence of a bar structure in the center. 

Elliptical galaxies, on the other hand, have a more rounded shape and lack the spiral arms seen in spiral galaxies. They are made up of mostly old stars and have little to no gas and dust, making them less active in terms of star formation. 

Irregular galaxies, as the name implies, have irregular shapes and do not fit into the categories of spiral or elliptical. They can vary greatly in size and contain young stars, gas, and dust, making them actively forming new stars. 

Understanding the different types of galaxies is crucial in studying the evolution and dynamics of our universe. Scientists continue to discover new galaxies and expand our knowledge of these fascinating structures. See the diagrams below for visual representations of each galaxy type.
