In this section, we will be discussing the different types of celestial bodies found in our solar system. From the massive gas giants to the tiny dwarf planets, each one plays a crucial role in our understanding of the universe.

The first type of celestial body we will discuss is the planet. Planets are large bodies that orbit a star and have enough mass to be rounded by their own gravity. Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are known as the terrestrial planets, while Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are known as the gas giants.

Next, we have moons. Moons are natural satellites that orbit planets and other celestial bodies. They can range in size from small rocks to larger bodies with their own atmospheres. Our moon, for example, is Earth's only natural satellite.

Another type of celestial body is asteroids. These are small, rocky bodies that orbit the Sun and are mostly found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Some asteroids can be as small as a grain of sand, while others can be hundreds of kilometers in diameter.

Comets are also important celestial bodies in our solar system. These are made up of ice, dust, and rocky debris and have highly elliptical orbits that bring them close to the Sun. When they get closer to the Sun, the ice begins to melt, creating the distinctive tail that we see from Earth.

Lastly, we have dwarf planets. These are similar to planets in that they orbit a star, but they have not cleared their orbit of other objects. Pluto, for example, is considered a dwarf planet.

Understanding the different types of celestial bodies in our solar system is crucial in understanding the formation and evolution of our universe. Refer to the diagram below for a visual representation of the different types of celestial bodies discussed.
