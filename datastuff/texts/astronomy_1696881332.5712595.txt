Topic: The Life Cycle of Stars

Stars are fascinating objects in the universe that play a crucial role in shaping the cosmos. They are massive, luminous balls of gas that are held together by gravity and undergo a series of changes throughout their lifetime. In this section, we will explore the life cycle of stars and discover the processes that lead to their formation, evolution, and eventual demise.

Formation:
Stars are born in large, dense clouds of gas and dust called nebulae. These nebulae are found in interstellar space and can range in size from a few light-years to hundreds of light-years. Within these nebulae, gravity causes the gas and dust to clump together, forming a protostar. As the protostar grows, it becomes hotter and denser, eventually reaching a temperature of millions of degrees, triggering nuclear fusion and becoming a star.

Main Sequence:
Once a star reaches a stable state, it enters the main sequence phase, where it will spend the majority of its lifetime. In this phase, the star will fuse hydrogen atoms in its core to form helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy in the process. This energy creates an outward pressure, which counteracts the gravitational force pulling the star inward, keeping it in a stable state.

Red Giant:
As a star ages, it begins to run out of hydrogen fuel in its core. Without this energy source, the outward pressure decreases, and the star's gravity causes it to collapse. As a result, the core heats up, causing the star's outer layers to expand and cool down, turning it into a red giant. During this phase, the star will become much larger and brighter, and it may consume any nearby planets or objects in its path.

Planetary Nebula and White Dwarf:
For stars with masses similar to the Sun, their final stage of life is to become a planetary nebula and then a white dwarf. In this phase, the star will shed its outer layers, leaving behind a hot, dense core known as a white dwarf. The white dwarf will continue to emit heat and light for billions of years until eventually fading away into a black dwarf.

Supernova and Neutron Star/Black Hole:
For stars with masses much larger than the Sun, their final stage of life is much more dramatic. As the star runs out of fuel in its core, it can no longer resist its massive gravitational forces,
