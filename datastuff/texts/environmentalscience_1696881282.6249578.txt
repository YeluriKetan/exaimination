Topic: The Carbon Cycle

The Carbon Cycle is a crucial process in the Earth's ecosystem that allows for the circulation of carbon between living organisms and the environment. It plays a vital role in regulating the Earth's temperature and sustaining life on the planet.

Carbon exists in various forms, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and organic compounds found in living organisms. The cycle begins with carbon being absorbed by plants through photosynthesis, converting CO2 into organic carbon compounds. These plants are then consumed by animals, and the carbon is transferred through the food chain.

As animals respire and release carbon back into the atmosphere, it becomes available for plants to absorb again. Additionally, the decomposition of dead organisms and waste products also releases carbon back into the environment. Over time, a portion of the carbon is stored in the soil, forming fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas.

Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly disrupted the carbon cycle, leading to an increase in atmospheric CO2 levels. This increase in greenhouse gases is a leading cause of global warming and climate change.

The illustration below depicts the different processes involved in the carbon cycle. It is essential to understand and monitor this cycle to mitigate the negative effects of human activities on the environment.
