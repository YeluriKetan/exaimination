Content: Plate Tectonics is the theory that explains the large-scale movements of the Earth's lithosphere. This theory was first proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912 and has since been supported by various pieces of evidence such as fossil distribution and rock formations.

At the core of the Plate Tectonics theory is the concept of continental drift, which suggests that the Earth's landmasses were once joined together in a single supercontinent called Pangaea. Over time, these landmasses drifted apart due to the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates.

The Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust and uppermost portion of the mantle, is divided into several large plates. These plates are constantly in motion, either moving away from each other (divergent boundaries), sliding past each other (transform boundaries), or colliding with each other (convergent boundaries).

Divergent boundaries can be found along mid-ocean ridges, where new crust is continuously created as molten rock rises and solidifies. This process, known as seafloor spreading, also results in the formation of underwater mountain ranges.

Transform boundaries, on the other hand, can be seen along fault lines where two plates are sliding past each other. These boundaries are responsible for most earthquakes as the plates rub against each other, releasing built-up tension.

Convergent boundaries are the most complex and can result in different geological features depending on the types of plates involved. When an oceanic plate collides with a continental plate, the denser oceanic plate subducts (sinks) beneath the lighter continental plate, creating a deep ocean trench and a volcanic mountain range. If two continental plates collide, they can push against each other, resulting in the formation of towering mountain ranges.

Plate Tectonics plays a significant role in shaping the Earth's surface and is responsible for natural phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the formation of mountains. Studying this theory allows us to better understand the dynamic nature of our planet and how it continues to evolve over time.
