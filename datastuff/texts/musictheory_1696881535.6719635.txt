The most common chord progression is the I-IV-V, also known as the 1-4-5 progression. This refers to the first, fourth, and fifth chords of a major scale. For example, in the key of C major, the I chord would be C, the IV chord would be F, and the V chord would be G.

Another common chord progression is the I-IV-V-IV, which adds an extra chord before returning to the IV chord. This progression is commonly used in blues and rock music.

There are many other chord progressions that can be used in music, and they all have different feelings and emotions attached to them. For example, minor chord progressions tend to sound more melancholic, while major chord progressions sound more happy and upbeat.

It is important to understand and recognize chord progressions in music, as they can help you anticipate the next chord and aid in improvisation. Below is a diagram showing the I-IV-V chord progression in the key of C major.
