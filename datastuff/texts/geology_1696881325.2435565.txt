On this page, we will be discussing the different types of rocks and their formation. Rocks are classified into three main categories: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic.

Igneous rocks are formed from molten magma that cools and solidifies. This can happen either beneath the Earth's surface, resulting in intrusive rocks, or on the surface, resulting in extrusive rocks. Examples of igneous rocks include granite, basalt, and obsidian.

Sedimentary rocks, on the other hand, are formed from sediments that have been deposited and compacted over time. This process is known as lithification. Some examples of sedimentary rocks include sandstone, limestone, and shale.

Lastly, metamorphic rocks are formed from existing rocks that have been subjected to high heat and pressure, causing them to change form and structure. Examples of metamorphic rocks include marble, slate, and gneiss.

It's important to note that the rock cycle is constantly in motion, with rocks constantly being formed, broken down, and reformed. Understanding the different types of rocks and how they are formed is crucial in understanding the Earth's history and processes. Refer to the diagram on the right for a visual representation of the rock cycle.
