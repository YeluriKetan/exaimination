Content: In organic chemistry, a functional group is a specific group of atoms or bonds within a molecule that is responsible for the characteristic chemical reactions of that molecule. Functional groups can be thought of as the key to a molecule's chemical behavior, as they determine its reactivity and properties. Common functional groups include alcohols, carboxylic acids, and amines. These groups can be identified by their specific arrangement of atoms and can be predicted based on their position in the periodic table. For example, alcohols are characterized by the presence of a hydroxyl (-OH) group, while carboxylic acids have a carboxyl (-COOH) group. By understanding the functional groups present in a molecule, chemists can better predict its behavior and reactions, making organic chemistry a highly important and practical field of study.
