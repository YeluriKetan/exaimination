On this page, we will be discussing the formation of stars and planets in our universe. Stars are formed when large clouds of gas and dust, called nebulae, collapse under their own gravity. As the cloud collapses, it heats up and begins to spin, forming a flattened disk shape. In the center of this disk, a dense concentration of gas and dust called a protostar begins to form.

As the protostar continues to attract more and more material, its core becomes hotter and denser, eventually reaching a temperature and pressure where nuclear fusion can occur. This is when the star is officially born.

But the formation of planets is a bit more complex. Planets form from leftover material in the protoplanetary disk orbiting the newly formed star. As this material clumps together, it begins to grow in size and eventually forms into planets. The size and composition of the planets is determined by their distance from the star, with larger and gas-rich planets forming further away, and smaller and rocky planets forming closer in.

The process of star and planet formation is an ongoing process in our universe, with new stars and planets constantly being created. Studying this process can give us insight into the origins of our own solar system and the diversity of planetary systems in our galaxy.
