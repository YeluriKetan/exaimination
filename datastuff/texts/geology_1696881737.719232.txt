On this page, we will discuss the different types of rocks and their formation processes. Rocks are classified into three main categories: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. 

Igneous rocks are formed when magma or lava cools and solidifies. This can happen either on or below the Earth's surface. The rate of cooling determines the texture of igneous rocks, with slower cooling resulting in larger crystals. Examples of igneous rocks include granite, basalt, and pumice. 

Sedimentary rocks are formed when sediments, which can be pieces of other rocks, minerals, or organic materials, are deposited and then compressed and cemented together by the weight of overlying layers. This process can take place on land or underwater. Common types of sedimentary rocks include sandstone, limestone, and shale. 

Metamorphic rocks are rocks that have undergone a physical or chemical change due to high heat and pressure. This can happen when rocks are buried deep within the Earth's crust or when they come into contact with hot magma. Examples of metamorphic rocks include marble, slate, and gneiss. 

Understanding the different types of rocks is important in geology as it can provide insights into the Earth's history and the processes that shape its surface. In the next chapter, we will dive deeper into the formation and characteristics of each type of rock. Look out for diagrams and real-life examples to better understand these concepts.
