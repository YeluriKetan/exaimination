Content: The Solar System is the name given to the collection of planets, moons, comets, and asteroids that orbit around our sun. It is estimated that the Solar System formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from a giant cloud of gas and dust known as the solar nebula.

The four inner planets, also known as the terrestrial planets, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These planets are relatively small and are made up of dense, rocky material. They also have shorter orbital periods and higher temperatures compared to the outer planets.

The four outer planets, also known as the gas giants, are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These planets are much larger in size and primarily made up of gas and ice. They have longer orbital periods and lower temperatures compared to the inner planets.

One interesting aspect of the Solar System is the asteroid belt, located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. It is a region of small rocky bodies, some of which have been captured by the gravitational pull of larger planets.

Studying the Solar System can help us understand how our own planet and others in our galaxy were formed. It also allows us to learn more about the potential for life on other planets and how our own planet may evolve in the future.
